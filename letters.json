Got to Council Grove at 2:30 P.M. and met all the prominent citizens in town, at \"the\" Building and Loan Association office. You'd think I was the President of the U.S. We discussed the National Old Trails, cussed Osage City, the next larger town to the east (we'll do the same for them when we go to Osage), and came over here to Herington. Arrived at 5:45, left Council Grove at 5:45. It is twenty-six miles, so we lost no time on the finest dirt road you ever saw. Had a flat tire at Burlingame. The hotel man called a garage and had it fixed while we ate the finest chicken dinner you ever saw with the leading lawyer, the county,judge (commissioner they call him out here), and a couple of other prominent citizens. Tonight we'll do the same here. It has been misting since 3:00 P.M. I don't know if it is going to rain but I hope not. I am feeling fine and dandy. My voice is improved. I've eaten a box of the whiskered bros. cough drops. Be sure and kiss my baby and look in the mirror for one for yourself. Will write you tomorrow. I wish you and the young lady were here.

I hope you'll let \nthe invitation be a standing\none though and I shall avail\nmyself of it at the very first\nopportunity.\nI guess Ethel + Nellie have \nbeen busy with thier exams,is the reason you haven't \nseen them.  I got a letter from\nEthel the other day saying she \nwas suffering so from cramming\nboth mental & physical and from \n\"apizootic\" (whatever that is) that \nshe and Nellie would be unable\nto come out this week.  You \nknow they always spend a \nfew days at Christmas out \nhere.  It was just as well \nas I would have had to,cancel thier date anyway after\npapa's accident.  We haven't quite\ngot over the excitement yet.  A \nhorse pulled a big beam over\non him in the barn.  We were so\nglad he wasn't killed we didn't\nknow what to do.\n  If you see fit to let me\nhear from you sometimes I \nshall certainly appreciate it.  Farm\nlife as an every day affair is not\ngenerally exciting.  Wishing you and\nall of you the very happiest New\nYear.  I am very sincerely\nHarry S. Truman"

Mamma says it is always customary to send blank sheets of paper today instead of written ones. Well perhaps you'd rather get the blank ones but I am going to fill these, and spoil the spirit of the day.\n\nYou see I have been sowing oats all week got done Thursday night and hauled about six tons of hay yesterday. My face is a sight as the girls say. You know the wind blew something,\"fierce\" last Tuesday & Wednesday and the sun also had some effect. Between <inserted>them</inserted> I look like raw beef or a confirmed \"[illegible] fighter\". My voice is also somewhat weary from yelling at the horses. You know we drive four plugs to a drill - have them abreast. It is an impossibility to have four with inclinations alike. I had four whose names may be some index to thier character- William Samuel Jane & X. X is a brone - if you know what that is - and he has an insane desire to arrive at the other end of the field in the shortest possible time. You dare not touch him with a whip or let him hear one if you can help. William - Bill we call him of course, is an ex buggy horse. He hasn't much idea of work but to get out of it if he can. I yell at him in my sleep sometimes. When I am not hollowing Bill, Bill go on, I am saying the samr to Sam. Sam is a very large exdray horse and he never hurries under any consideration unless I poke him with a sharp stick or land on him with a baling wire whip. Jane, as Mrs Barclay would say is just right. She goes as she should.,Well when I land on Sam & Bill Jane and X want to run away. So I have to take it out in lung work and unprintable names. You can just bet that I am glad I'm done. I always sow Vivians and mine too. This time I sowed seventy acres in five days. That is moving some. Vivian is well and has been hauling hay for me while I sowed his oats. (I do wish I had your new bottle of ink.) Did you get an invitation the High School reception for Prof Bryant? I did but I can't go. I have a previous engagement to a tacky party. I am,going as I usually go when at home and I bet I take the cake. My very best friends would refuse to recognize me if they ever saw me in town in my farm rags. They are dirty and tattered & torn with hog snoot marks, splashed milk and other things to numerous to mention in thier make up. You ask Ethel what a pretty figure I cut when I pretend to work. Mamma ropes me in once in while and makes me exchange for a clean set, but they don't feel right until I wear them a day or two.,I am glad your \"umbrell\" is a useful as well as ornamental article. You know they generally are not both.\n\nI would certainly be glad to attend church with you in Independence and hear your choir.\n\nI guess you <scratched out>had</scratched out> will have a fine time at the river tomorrow morning. I haven't been down on those bluffs since I was a time keeper for L. J. Smith. You know I was once a hobo pay master. Not a pleasant job either.\n\nI am sorry to hear of Miss [illegible]'s illness but I guess she'll soon recover. Lively people are never sick long. I hope your mother is well by this time. Our whole family is in good health. Papa only has to hop on crutches but he'll soon be over that.\n\nYou say you have gone back to W D Howells, well I have never come to him yet. He must be all right for he was a particular friend of Mark Twain's. It's luck I guess but I never read one of his books. I certainly did enjoy the,\"Mistress of Shenstone\". I have read The Rosary since I read it and they are both good. I have also been reading the history of Jenghiz Khan the Tartar. He is the only great man in history who had no effect on American History according to Miss Phelps. You know she began with Adam and came down. But I never heard of Jenghiz till recently. Well I am wound up but shall quit here. Please write me when you have the time as I enjoy your letters very much I am\n\nSincerely\nHarry"

It makes no difference about the variety just so it's cake.\n\nI think you and Nellie could probably get up some religious excitement on Ethel's part if you would do as a certain woman did Aunt Susan was telling me about.\n\nYou they they used to hold out door meetings when the weather was good and every one for miles around attended and stayed sometimes for weeks. Along in the [illegible] they were holding a meeting not far from here and the preacher had exhorted and ranted and done everything else they usually do when they try to get something started as they call it but it was no use.  He wasn't a quitter though. Finally down one of the aisles one of the good sisters jumped out and began screaming and dancing up and down as they usually do when they get religion. The preacher made a dive for her with his hand extended,saying \"Oh! sister I am so glad to see you come out and say you have religion\" Her answer between screams was \"I haven't got it I haven't got it There's a lizard on my dress and she kept on dancing until Aunt Sue and someone else took her outside and one of these little lizards fell of her dress. Try it on Ethel. It will work I think.\n\nI remember Miss Southern very well your opinion of her is good. Mary said that the preacher was giving dancers card players and theater goers fits. Well he has done all these things until he is tired,[embossed \"T\" letterhead]   of them. Now he has taken to no preaching for a change. I also have stayed from the Presbyterian fold though I remember my Sunday school days very well. I am by religion like everything else. I think there is more in acting than in talking. I had an uncle who said when one of his neighbors got religion strong on Sunday he was going to lock his smoke house on Monday. I think he was right from the little I have observed.\n\nWe had a neighbor out here who could pray louder and talk more fervently in meetin' than anyone I,<inserted>ever</inserted> heard. He'd say in every prayer \"O Lord help this congregation to stop and think where they's a given at. We finally found that he beat his wife and did everything else that's \"onery.\"\n\nI think religion is something one should have on Wednesday and Thursday as well as Sunday. Therefore I don't believe that these protracted meetings do any real good they are mostly excitement and when the excitement wears off people are as they always were.\n\nI like to play cards and dance as far as I know how and go to shows and do all the things they said I shouldn't but I don't feel badly about it. I go when I feel like it and the <underlined>good</underlined> church members are glad to hear what it's like. You see I'm a member but not a strenuous one.,I suppose I am getting to be a bore by this time but I like to get letters so well especially from you that I do the best I can to deserve them. I shall be in Independence on the 14th to attend the Probate Court (think of it) and if you are at home \n\nI should like very much to come around again.\n\nI am glad your mother like my efforts on the piano. I am ashamed of it myself. But you know a farmer can't be a pianist much as he'd like to be. Mary is getting to be a pretty good piano player ivory tickler as short Short says. He says his piano has a wheel barrow movement and a fine escapement. It was an old fashioned square.\n\nWrite when you can to\n\nYours sincerely\nHarry\n\nCan't spell my own name."

    "content": "Grandview, MO\nMar 19 1911\n\nDear Bessie:-\nI sincerely hope you enjoyed the playing of that musical editor as well as I did. He was simply great. You know that I think when good music is played in his style it is always enjoyable. I hope I didn't cause you to do anything against your religious principles. You know that I know nothing about Lent and such things and when I was urging you to go with us to dinner at the Baltimore,I was merely thinking of giving you all a good time. That was the first time I was ever at an Episcopal Church and I like the service very much. But I guess I'll have to remain a Lightfoot Baptist for a while yet anyway. You know I told you that I also had strayed from the Presbyterian fold; but I went in the other direction. In place of more form we haven't any. But there are many things I do not like. For instance they do not want a person to go to shows or dance or do anything for a good time. Well I like to do all those things and play cards besides. So you see I am not very strong as a Baptist. Anyhow I don't think any church on earth will take you to heaven if you're not real anyway. I believe in people living what they believe and talking afterwards, don't you? Well hang religion anyway; it's a dull subject; but I'll not ask you to dance any more till after Easter Sunday. Will that be all right?\n\nMary has not arrived home yet. The last I heard of her she was in Independence.,When she gets down there she never knows when to come home, and I don't blame her. I like Independence and if I ever get rich enough to retire (be a retired farmer, ah.) I think I'll land in Independence.\n\nWe go to sowing oats in the morning. It will take a week or two as we have about 80 Acres to sow. Mr. Hall wanted to know of me if we were planting wheat now. You know a town farmer always gets his seeds mixed. We sow wheat, oats and grass seed and plant corn and potatoes. See the difference? I did certainly enjoy Miss Dicey's,(I guess that's how you spell her) excitable conversation. I bet she is a person who enjoys life. You know when people can get excited over the ordinary things in life they live. You know a good author makes common things seem great in books and people who can live them that way always enjoy life. I never did know but one boy that way and only one man. Neither of them can cross the street with out having an adventure worth telling of.\n\nWhen she was telling about those chickens and that trip to St. Louis I thought I'd go up. I guess,they thought I was a perfect chump because I forgot to tell them and you too that I enjoyed the evening but I most certainly did and you please tell them will you? Next time I'll do better provided I can have a next time.\n\nMamma has seven little chickens and more coming. They looked rather out of place when we had that snow. I told her she would have to begin knitting socks if she was going to raise chickens in the winter. The last few days have been fine on them though. One of my numerous cousins was over this evening and she had seventy six chickens big enough to fly. They were incubator chickens. I hope you don't cook yours before they hatch. They say that is generally what happens the first time. So be careful.\n\nDid you get your suitcase alright? I wish we had thought and taken it to the N.Y. Life Bldg and then we could have got it. No one ever thought that man would play over time. They don't generally. \n\nNow please don't wait so long to write as I do enjoy your letters even if you,do call them notes.\n\nWhat do you think of Ms. E.C.W.? Isn't she a caution? Sometime when she has a swell recital if you care to go out we'll go and then you'll see her show off proper.\n\nWell I'm going to quit because I have run over time but if you don't want to read remember you owe me a letter now and I am looking for it.\n\nSincerely yours\nHarry.\n\nPlease forget that spot it [illegible]\n\nPostmark Date 3-21-11"

Vivian hasn't said a word about them to me. I shall corner him tonight. I have an idea a certain lady friend of his could tell me where they are if he doesn't. I shall try and make reparation for the book if it doesn't eventually reach you. I have enjoyed Nicanor immensely. I suppose it depicts Roman life realistically but I like for them to be more cheerful,about it. I am going to read the book again. I found out the name of a Roman Emperor that history never says anything about in it. He [scratched out] really existed too.  You see I haven't anything to do but run down historic rumors and every book I read since I have been laid up that mentions anyone at all in history I never heard of causes me to look him up.  I always forget him five minutes afterwards but I have the satisfaction of knowing he was anyway.\n\nI really wish Rex Beach would do something with that Ne'er Do Well and be done with it. It makes you feel like the end of the year instead of the middle of the [illegible] he chairs it out. I've an idea the poor boy'll loose his job now and his girl and then have a love [illegible] with his old man come back and get the girl and the P. R. R. and live happily until alimony time. What do you think?\n\nMary's <inserted>mine also</inserted> cousin in Texas sent her two horned toads in a box by mail the other day. She thought it was a box of pills. It was all wrapped up and very small. You ought to have heard her squawk when she opened the box. You know they have tails and horns on thier heads <inserted>thier tails are not on thier heads.</inserted>and are furious looking little brutes, but are harmless. They feast on <scratched out>fly</scratched out> flies, ants etc. I don't see how these two lived for the box was air tight.\n\nMary and Vivian went to the Ruskin High School Commencement Thursday night. Said it was fine,I guess they are all fine the first few times but when very many pass they get old don't you think? They sure must be getting nifty in Independence if the ushers wanted to wear clair hammer coats. Thats spreading things thick. The KC Post has offered $10.00 for the prettiest graduation dress not to cost over $5.00. Do you suppose one can be made for that?\n\nThat rain was the finest thing this year. If it hadn't come we would have gone to the wall sure enough. Now we expect to raise something anyway. I hate rainy days generally but these last ones sure looked good to me.\n\nI have an illustration of what happens to people who set grocery store eggs. I am enclosing it. Did any of yours,come out that way? Literature [illegible] it do not go very well with poultry do they? One good gang of poultry <scratched out>though</scratched out> does more for the country though than all the art has Yerkes could buy. You know I think a man artist or pianist is the last thing on earth. They do no good for themselves or anyone else. I never did see one who paid his debts if there was anyway to aviod it. That shows his artistic temperament, that, a lot of long hair and a kangaroo walk. Sometimes they go dingy or get two or three divorces. That also is a temperamental sign. Some French alienist says that geniuses are insane anyway. I guess he is right in some,cases anyway. It is all right to be an artist or pianist if you are a real genius like Shevine or Hoffman or Turner or Whistler but the ordinary run of every day artists and pianists who imitate these men won't do.\n\nI really thought once I'd be an ivory tickler but I am glad my money ran out before I got too far. Who knows maybe I'll be a Cincinnatus and be elected constable some day.\n\nIf you had called up the other day I'd have made it to the phone some way. I can get around the house to some extent. Soon as ever I can persuade the MD. to take the cast off I'll do fine. I hope you'll consider this worthy an answer I'd like to see me - sure I bet its fine. This is the end of my stationary. Sincerely Harry."

    "content": "Grandview, Mo.\nNovember 1, 1911\n\nDear Bessie:\n\nI am most awful glad you think a letter to me worthwhile. They are more than worthwhile to me. You can never guess how glad I am to get them.\n\nI really didn't mean to put my principal desire in the past tense. That is something that will never be past with me. My grammar was at fault, that's all.\n\nI suppose Ethel has told you all about the wedding. I was scared nearly to death and so was Vivian. Lucella was as calm as if she'd been married a dozen times before. She is more like my Grandmother,Young than anyone I know. If my dear Pete doesn't make a success with her to help him, he should be blotted out. Everyone is so well satisfied with the match something surely will happen. Even her grandmother thinks Vivian is almost good enough for her, and Mamma says she's too good for him. They are down to pa-in-law's tonight. Vivian actually told me that they were going to town tomorrow to buy the furniture they need. I guess they'll be at home Monday or Tuesday. The charivari is set for Saturday I think. If it is, I'll not be present for I am coming to Independence if you'll be at home. I am going with Mary and Ethel and Nellie to the Shubert Saturday afternoon and I'd like very much to come down that night, provided of course that you have nothing better to do.\n\nI want an auto so badly tonight I really don't know what to do. I have a special invitation to assist in the dedication of a new Lodge at Swope Park. I shall stay at home because I'd simply be a chunk of ice by the time I drove to 67th Street in a buggy. I couldn't go on the train because Papa and I had to pull up the carrots and beets and bury them this afternoon so they wouldn't freeze. If ever I get my debts paid and then have something left, I'm going to invest it in a benzine buggy, as the hobos say. Then I suppose I'll have the debts to pay over. Just imagine how often I'd burn the pike from there to Independence. I guess,you'd better be glad I haven't one for I'd simply make myself monotonous to you. I guess there'll not be much danger of my coming too often this winter for I'll have to work for true, Ethel to the contrary notwithstanding. I always make it a point to invite them out when things are arranged so I haven't anything to do but tease and torment them. That is how Ethel arrived at her conclusion.\n\nThe W.M. series begins soon I see. Don't you forget you have pianist dates to go with me. Pianists are all I can stand this winter. I am crazy about any kind of pretty music but of course I can appreciate pianists most. Mary has been practicing on a Mozart sonata that has the most beautiful melody I know of. It makes you think of Greek,and Roman fairy stories. Did you ever sit and listen to an orchestra play a fine overture and imagine that things were as they ought to be and not as they are? Music that I can understand always makes me feel that way. I think some of the old masters must have been in communication with a fairy goddess of some sort. That is Mozart, Chopin, and Verdi were. Wagner and Bach evidently were in cahoots with Pluto. Did you ever know that some of those men wrote the worst trash imaginable for potboilers? Raff has over a thousand compositions and about nine hundred are fit for nothing. He'd write one very time he got hungry. I guess you can't blame the poor man. That is the reason rulers should be wise enough to pick,the geniuses and pension them so they can do their best. It seems to me that they would be easy enough picked out because they always beat their wives, or run away with some other man's. Wouldn't Reno be full of pensioners?\n\nI hope you'll be home Saturday. If you're not, it'll be my loss of course. I'll phone in the morning sometime after I get to town.\n\nYou see, I am sending you the other half of that sheet I tore in two before.\n\nI want you to show me some stenciling when I come down. I never saw any I guess, even it is ancient. If I have, I knew it not. You owe me a letter now. Next time I'll wind up and fill two full sheets. Now you know what's coming, so beware.\n\nSincerely, Harry"

Crutches are certainly the most inconvenient conveniences I have ever run up against. You've no idea how experience teaches sympathy. I have thought a many time that some of the antics of people on crutches were unnecessary to say the least. I don't think so now. It really takes an expert to accomplish anything with them .,It is necessary for me to wear my uncles overalls because I can't get my plaster cast through the leg of mine.  He weighes 240 and a large part of his weight is around the waist. You can imagine the beautiful profile I make. I don't care for looks now though I wan to get out of bed and I'd almost wear a dress to do it.\n\nI certainly thank you for the book you sent. It is fine. I haven't quite finished it yet. I sent you a copy of Life by Ethel. It is so good. I thought that I couldn't keep it all to myself. I had wrapped it for mailing when Ethel and Aunt Ella showed up. I hope you hadn't seen it. The center cartoon is particullarly entrancing. I should certainly like the opportunity of being a Joyrider. I really don't think I'd be one but I'd just like to have the means to be one.\n\nI was very glad to see Ethel and so I didn't attempt to [illegible] her back hair as I had threatened to do.  Anyway I don't believe I could have done it just yet so I let well enough alone. She was perfectly willing for me to try.\n\nYou said Frank was anxious to go to Mexico. You tell him he'd better stay out of Greaserdom right now anyway. If a fellow,could go as the rear guard of a victorious American army it would be all right but right now the chances are good that he'd stop a bullet. I am like Mark Twain. He says that if fame is to be obtained only by marching to the canon's mouth he was perfectly willing to go there provided the canon is empty, it it is loaded he'd get over the fence and go home. Some times the canon's breech is as dangerous as it's mouth. A member of the Battary got his fingers connected with the breech block on one of those 3 inch guns not long ago and left on of them in the gun. I think I shall quit the military stunt in June,My time is out then. I have been a member for six years and have had lots of fun learned a little bit and made some friends so I guess I'd better quit while I am all in one piece. Out at Ft Riley once while the outfit was out there a shell exploded at the mouth of the gun and killed seven or eight who standing too far front. So you see a person is not absolutely safe either in front or behind the gun. Mark's advice is best.\n\nOne of mamma's cousins in visiting us now who was in the real Confederate Army. He was at the Battle of Vicksburg and Corinth and also up here at the Battle of Westport. He,thinks that Gen. Price was the greatest man that ever lived. Of all the hair lifting war tales Cousin William sure contribute his share. It really seems funny that in this very country even right where we live people should have been afraid to go any where unless there was several together. Then maybe the Red legs or Bushwhackers would kill them. Grandmother once routed a whole band of Indian with a big dog. She was all alone except for a negro woman and two of her children. These Indians told her they wanted honey and if she didn't give it they would take it and her too. So they sharpened thier knives on the grinding stone and then she turned loose a large dog. Away went Indians some leaving thier blankets. If I had been Grandma I'd have disappeared out the front way when they came up the back. But she didn't and finally made them go.\n\nI guess you'll think this is a mighty tiresome attempt at a letter but it is the best I can do today. I read some Chinese Poetry this morning and I guess that is the reason I can't do any better. It,was rendered into English but even then it sounded as bad as the hen tracks they made for writing look. So if this is too dull to read I hope you'll con<scratched out: d>sider that you owe me a letter for it anyway. \n\nI want to thank you again for the Mistress of Shenstone as I sure enjoyed it and so did the rest of us.\n\nI hope your calico chickens will be a success and I am really glad you didn't have to use that awful dip. Vivian has to dip chickens out here. I eat them. Well write when you cand and if I land that machine I'll <underlined>try and use it right</underlined> Sincerely    \n                                                                                                                          Harry"

I should be just as pleased to get a letter fom your on wrapping paper as on the finest stationary built. So write whether you have any stationary or not although that last looked good enough for anybody to me.\n\nI am sorry to hear of your chickens dying. Mamma has lost quite a number though. She says it is the cold damp weather more than anything else and then some of hers she says have been supporting families upon themselves. She is going to dip them as soon,as the weather will permit and then she says they'll be all right.\n\nI had a letter from Nellie saying she was going to quit teaching in Independence and go down to Sugar Creek. They offered her a large salary. I told her not to fall in love with a bohunk but if she ran across a Standard Oil Magnate to nab him.\n\nYour remarks on the petting and privilege of the oldest one of a family are absolute true as I can testify from experience. Although the other two back me down that I am always the petted one.\n\nI have been reading David Copperfield and have really found out that I couldn't appreciate Dickens before. I have only read Oliver Twist and Tale of Two Cities. They didn't make much of an impression and I never read anything else. A neighbor sent me Domby & Son & David C and I am glad for it has awakened a new interest. It is almost a reconciliation to having my leg broken to contemplate the amount of reading I am going to do this summer. I am getting better fast and I am afraid I'll get well so soon I won't get to read enough. Isn't that an awful thought?\n\nI really don't mind staying in the house on rainy clouldy days like this but when they,are nice like last Sunday. I can hardly sit still. I begin to think of corn to plant garden to make grass seed to sow and a hundred and one things to do and then I pick up a magazine and forget it. I am not worrying much I guess for they tell me I am getting fat. Then papa is able to get around now and will soon throw his crutches away and then things will hum.\n\nI guess I won't get rich this year although we did break up a field that hasn't had a crop raised on it since 1873. I was figuring on raising 5000 bushels of corn and at least paying my debts but as Mr Micawber says,my creditors will have to wait. I do think Mr Micawber is the killingist person I have run across in any book any where. He is exactly true to life. I know a half dozen of him right here in Grandview. They are always waiting for something to turn up and for someone to die and leave them something. I never expect to be rich but if I can't make what I get myself without waiting for someone to leave it to  me I hope somebody will knock me on the head and put me out of danger.\n\nI am sorry Ethel didn't get out Sunday as I'd <scratched out> like to see her as well as get the book. I told Nellie,to tell her if she didn't bring it out next Sunday I am going to get in an ambulance and come after it.\n\nI guess you'll have a good time with you bridge club.  Speaking of people crying at play.  I don't think there is anything funnier.  That is the only way I enjoy a tragedy is to laugh at those who cry.  Uncle Harrison says he rather go to the Orpheum and laugh all evening then sit and grate the enamel off his false teeth to see Mansfield or Sothern or any other big gun. He is very near right I think. Well I hope you'll consider this worth an answer as I'll be glad to get one. Am hoping to be around in ten days anyway.\nSincerely\nHarry"

I hope we get rain anyway. If I just had a horse that was equal to the drive this hot weather I'd certainly make Independence, but I haven't and my auto friends always want to take me the opposite direction. They generally come and get me when they have an,errand to do. I wouldn't ask one of them to take me anywhere because they always think they confer a magnificent favor on any one they ride around. When I can throw my sticks away streetcars will be good enough for me. I think I can get rid of them in a few days. A new Masonic Lodge is being organized at our town and they have given the principle office. I have the big head terribly. The deputy Grand Master was out to see us Wednesday night, and handed me an awful lot of hot air. I haven't quite recovered from the effects yet.\n\nDo you really think Minnie would want the clock set back now? I thought it usually took some time before they wished things undone. They tell me that the first month she can burn the biscuit every morning if she chooses and its all right, but after that she learns what a good cook her ma in law was. And the first few months he can be as no account and good for nothing as he wants to be but he soon learns his pa in law made his money.,Then its ho for Reno or South Dakota. It is certainly awful what pessimists those two places have made people.  I am a Catholic when it comes to divorce. I believe people could generally settle thier differences if they weren't so all fired selfish.\n\nI guess you do miss Frank. I bet you don't he don't find any surplus wheat. We'll probably eat corn bread this season. That is provided it rains even in time for corn. I hope he has a good time while he is gone.\n\nWe are living on bread and bacon with some canned goods thrown in. I can sympathize with those western,rummies now who can never raise a garden. Ours is a total failure. We had one measly little mess of peas and there was more soup than peas then. One of our neighbors who has a big orchard says that all the apples are falling off green. I am doing the usual farmer act now. They are always starving to death.\n\nIt looks as if Columbus was going to smear it on the Bhiz don't it? I'd like to see one of the games between them. What are you doing to pass this hot weather? I have been spending my time at Grandview in order to keep from reading my eyes out.,Augusta Evans Wilson has been entertaining me with The Speckled Bird. Mrs Wilson, Mary J Holmes and Mrs Southworth <scratched out> so stilted and prim that they are actually ridiculous I can't bear them if I can get something else. I'll even read Geo Elliott or the Essay of Marcus Aurelius. I am going to work now very soon. It seems good to loaf when you can't but when you have to it is disgusting. I hope you'll consider that you owe me a letter as I ask after every mail to see if you've sent me one. I wonder how Ethel likes the \"job\" I gave her? Write when you can to   Sincerely yours  Harry"

If you only knew how glad I am to get them, you wouldn't be so short with them. I suppose I am too crazy about you anyway. Every time I see you I get more so, if it is possible. I know I haven't any right to but there are certain things that can't be helped, and that is one of them. I wouldn't help it if I could you know.\nI guess you are lucky that you,don't care-as even the best of fellow, which I am not, couldn't very well make a girl happy on nothing a week and a hat- full of debts. You see, I was fool enough or good enough, whichever way you look at it to go in with daddy even on his debts. Say, don't ever mention that as no one knows he has any, especially his relatives, See?\n\nReally though if I thought you cared, I bet I could win out anyway in spite of all the kin in creation.\n\nThis is a mighty poor Christmas letter but our dear relatives have succeeded in giving us the bluest Christmas since grandmother died. If you could see the allegations in the brief, you'd think my mother was the prime lady villain. It makes me so mad I could fight a boilermaker. They even accused our grandmother of being weak minded and most everything else-when she was the best businesswoman I ever expect to see. If we'd ever mentioned property to her, that itself would have finished us-as it should have done.\n\nBessie, if my dear men friends who invited themselves to dinner here Christmas go home on the afternoon train, I am,going to try and see you Christmas evening if you are at home. I'll call up if I can, or if I can't, about five-thirty. But don't stay at home on my account because I may not get to come. I'll bring you a copy of Richeileu if I come. I got Edwin Booth's prompt copy for fifteen cents. It's a stirring play I tell you. Mamma and Mary are going to see Julius in the afternoon. Maybe you'll run into them.\n\nI sent you a piece of tin jewelry the other day. I got it some time ago but found a busted link in the chain and had to have it renewed, so when I got it again I just sent it--that's why so early. With a Merry Christmas, I am, as always,\n\nYour Harry,"

    "content": "[Grandview, Mo. July 17, 1912]\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI had started you the most doleful letter you ever got from me Monday. It was one long apology for getting sick Sunday and not being able to hear Bryan on Tuesday. After looking it over I've decided to discard the whole sheet and start new. Though I doubt if my empty head can conjure up anything that will interest you. Remember I was up,till one on Thursday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday, getting up each day at five. You can see that even Napoleon couldn't expect any more of a person in the way of wakefulness. Wednesday I was to see you. Thursday we had callers ourselves. Friday lodge. Saturday went calling and you know where I went Sunday and Tuesday. I had the most cussed nap Sunday morning you ever read of. I told you I think that Uncle Harrison occupied a bed in my room Saturday night and began arousing me at half past four. I finally got up at six and decided to take a nap from seven to ten. The telephone and neighbors calling knocked that out. So with all my loss of sleep I must,have been very poor company Sunday night. For the rest of this week it is the hay for me at 9 P.M. except of course Friday for the D.D.G.M. of the 59th Masonic District of Missouri. And Sunday night if you'll let me come. Maybe I'll have to work and can't. I hope not though.\n\nYou really don't know how much I enjoyed Mr. Bryan. I am one of his staunchest admirers. Mr. B.,would not have been half so good though had you not been present. You know any show is good to me, unless it's positively rotten, if I can only see it with you. Let's hope that some rainy, cool day soon, real soon, the sooner the better, that we have lunch in K.C. at - well, the Hinkydink? on Tenth and Grand or some other place equally as good or,better, and then see all the pictures that can be crowded into four hours. What say you? That'll be a regular Twelfth Street stunt but if a person don't have a good time doing what everybody does, he'll live a mighty bored life, won't he? I'm sure you must like picture shows or you wouldn't go every night in the week. My conscience still hurts me a little yet for keeping you from going to the Chautauqua in the evening Tuesday. If I'd only kept my head shut about K.C., I'll bet you'd have gone. Well a person must do the wrong thing sometimes just so he can have something to be sorry for. I can positively assure you, though, you missed not much. Thought it might have been better than what you did see. I'm no judge though and thought that,show pretty good.\n\nDo you know I did the orneriest thing this afternoon. I was cutting oats right here close to the house and amputated the left foot of an old hen with five chickens. I felt badly about it too. She was over in the oats, where I couldn't see her till I'd already done it. Mamma says she'll get all right. I hope so. I'd rather do most anything than to hurt something that can't tell me,what it thinks of me for doing it. That old hen was more worried over what became of her chickens than she was over her foot. There are people who could very well profit by her example.\n\nPlease forgive the Sunday school book story, but it happened and that's what I thought of it.\n\nPlease \"borrow\" more of George's paper when you write, not because of the,silver letters but because it holds more and makes a longer letter. He maybe won't miss a few sheets and besides I bet he used lots of yours last winter.\n\nTell your mother her fine dinner made me entirely well and I'm as good as new. That Sally L. was sure fine, as good as if you'd made it. That's some compliment too. Write quick.\n\nSincerely, Harry"

    "content": "Grandview, Mo. January 12, I think [1912]\n\nDear Bessie,\n\nMy South Missouri Limited left Sheffield on the dot and was two hours late at Grandview, which I think is a record that would be hard to beat. There were only about twenty passengers and we had to do acrobatic stunts up and down the aisle and take turns at an old stove at one end of the car to keep warm. I didn't get cold, but there was a woman and a baby that did, at least the kid made a nose as if it was. Coming from the depot I really got too hot. You know I had a cap, mittens, and overshoes waiting for me and I walked,as if His Majesty was behind me, which made me feel as if he was. Do you know they had quit looking for me and had eaten all the hot mince pie. That made me wish more than ever that I had stayed in Independence. Mary finally went and got me a piece that was cold and I managed to eat it. Just a half pie was all. Not all I ate-just all the pie I ate.\n\nI have something I want to say now while it's on my mind. I think you look better in that black dress you wore Thursday evening than in anything I ever saw you wear. I intended telling you so when you wore it to the show in K.C. but the proper opportunity didn't appear. The strawberry blond isn't in it with you when you wear that dress. Or any other time for that matter. That sounds awful mushy don't it? It's not though when it is meant. Will you please tell me how you made that caramel dessert you had for dinner the time before this last when I was there? I can taste that from memory yet. It was undoubtedly nectar of the gods. I am going to coerce Mary into making me enough to founder on if you'll tell me how it's made.\nHow did Miss Jessie and Miss Dicie enjoy the show?\n\nI guess the kids spread themselves on Friday,night. I wish I'd stayed and gone again. It was so cold I had to postpone our Lodge meeting anyway. I really don't know what I am going to do if people take me for Mr. Brightman. I can't get over it some way. Aunt Ella said someone took me for Tom [illegible] when I was in Emery, Bird, Thayer's with Ethel just before Christmas. I really don't see what I've done to merit such treatment. Of course the other people may feel as badly over it as I do, but that doesn't help matters. How would you like to be taken for Miss Jennie? Really it will be dangerous to your good name to be seen out with me if they keep it up. I'll have to hock my overcoat and buy a black one and get a monocle for,each eye, then I'll be a person all myself.\n\nI just got a fine letter from Miss Maggie. She forgave me for not coming to her dinner party and said she'd give me a dinner yet and I need not take her to a show just because I didn't get there. I'm going to take her now, sure. Miss Maggie thinks too well of me, that is, she has too good an opinion of me. I wish she didn't. It's awful hard to live up to good opinions and do the right thing at the right time, especially when you have an insane desire to do something real ornery. I have always had that desire but never the nerve to put it over publicly yet. Some day,perhaps I'll create a small stir among my friends and acquaintances by robbing the bank (the clock stopped when I wrote that) or doing some other Diamond Dick stunt. You know, I like adventure-when it's somebody else's adventure. I may even persuade you to run off with me someday when you're not in your right mind exactly.\n\nNow you owe me a letter on the strength of that last statement if no other. Please send it along. The lawyer's coming tomorrow and Harry stays at home, so be sure and write.\n\nSincerely, Harry"

It is sprinkling rain now and prospects are good for a trash mover. I caught the Limited last night all right. There were five or six got off at Grandview. Most of them were well diggers for Mr. Johnson. It's nice to have company when you are scared, even if you don't know the company extra,well. It was as dark as a stack of purple cats last night, and both dogs attempted to eat me up as I came into the gate. I told Mary that I intended giving the collie to you. She nearly had a spasm. She pretends to be very much attached to it. I think that two dogs are generally two too many. We have a good neighbor up the road who has three big fat ones and his horses and cows are so poor they can hardly navigate. One dog is a sufficiency on a farm and one too many in town. They say that when an assessor doesn't want to be reelected, the best thing for him to do is to enumerate all the dogs in his district. I have an idea that it would be very effective if a person had a desire for unpopularity.,Aileen and Uncle Harrison are both here. I have had a fuss with Aileen already. I didn't do anything but throw a small piece of bread at her. It had some pea soup on it, but I wasn't aware of that fact until it landed on her neck. She has been very cool ever since that chunk of bread took her one in the neck. Some people are touchy anyway. She'll get over it if she stays long around here. What Aileen needs is two or three,brothers to pick on her turn about. I guess you can appreciate what a fine effect brothers have on girls.\n\nMy dear uncle is squalling for me to come and entertain him at a game of cooncan. Can you play it? It's some game if you play for fun, or if you have plenty of money and are lucky. I only play for fun with him. I'd be hope,lessly broke forever if I had to part with a dollar every time he beat me. That's the usual price of a game. I hope most sincerely that it will rain itself out before the Fourth, and also that it will rain enough Saturday that Bill can't think of Warrensburg and yet leave the roads good too. I shall be on deck at your house about nine o'clock or 8:45. It will be necessary for us to leave at not later than nine because the train leaves Sheffield at 9:33. We will then arrive at Pete's at about eleven, a very proper hour for country-style.\n\nIt's necessary that I draw this,to a close. Uncle Harry is having a fit to play cards and he's gotten to the point where he has to be concilliated (can't spell it). I hope your knee got well. I forgot to ask about it Sunday. You should have limped a little to remind me. Well I hope to see you Friday evening as well as Sunday morning. You owe me a letter. Please use tablecloth-size, like this.\n\nSincerely Harry"

    "content": "[Grandview Oct. 29, 1913]\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI am going to send you a late letter anyway, hoping I'll get one before the week's out. My Blug meeting was a very tame affair. The boozers were not out and I was persuaded to defer any action in regard to selling the hot stuff until after Nov. 11 when Grandview is going to have a Township Fan. As Pres of the Coral Club I instructed a committee to buy some advertising matter and also to raise some money to buy it with. It seems that money has to be in everything.,I am almost persuaded some times that it's bigger than most things. Exbartenders are well represented in the House of Lords (Brewers they call themselves) as well as in New Yorks most exclusive set. All on account of their ill gotten gains. Theres no use being a sourdough though. As Bertha M. Clay would say it's better to be poor but honest even if it does hurt like -- blazes sometimes. In the last month nearly every person I've dealt with in business has taken some cash and left me holding the sack. It's a good thing I wasn't appointed on the committee to raise money because I'd be tempted to embezzle some of the funds.\n\nWe are due to have a card party at our house tomorrow night. Some of the Grandview folks are coming down to learn to play 500, with me to tell 'em how. Won't that be a joyous job. I am going to have a good time at it anyway though. They are all rather hilarious and you know I'm not very backward myself when it comes to making noise. If I could only make money as easily as I can,stir up a racket, I'd have begged, persuaded, or cajoled you into thinking Harry was the nicest boy in seventeen states. But never mind, my ship's going to come in yet and if it doesn't have you aboard it'll only be a charred hulk and not worth the candle. You know, I told you once before that I thought you the superlative of excellence in everything and I think it harder all the time. I've been crazy about you ever since I can remember. I hope it's a mutual admiration society because then I can work harder and not get half so tired. You know, when the motive's strong,enough a man can do most anything if he's got the stuff in him. Perhaps I haven't got it but there is nothing like trying to find out.\n\nWho knows, I may be His Excellency the Governor of Montana someday (hee haw). How would you like to be Mrs. Governor?\n\nI dreamed that I owned a German silver mine in Wyoming last night! Wasn't that a grand dream on a piece of bride's cake? I guess the spangles and white fronts gave me the silver suggestion, but where under heaven could,I get the German part? From my granddad on my mother's side I guess. He was a Dutchman.\n\nPapa has gone to sleep in his chair. He's waiting very patiently for me to finish my letter so he can go to bed. He occupies the couch down here by the stove. I don't feel a bit like going to bed now I've got the habit of staying up I guess. But my oh me, how I hate to arise at 5:00 A.M. It has to be done though when Papa's around home. If he goes to bed at half-past four he gets up at five and so do I. Mamma is a sleepyhead like me. She never wants to get up but she can stay up till the small hours at night.\n\nI guess this letter is a mixture and doesn't amount to much. I hope you'll answer it though. My letters get one day later every week. You'll get this one Friday unless I mail it on the K.C.S. at six-thirty tomorrow. I lost one,by doing that and I'm not going to do it again.\n\nHope to see you Sunday evening and get a letter Sunday morning.\n\nMost sincerely, Harry\n\nPapa's going to K.C. tomorrow if I can trust him maybe you'll get this Thursday."

    "content": "Dear Bess!\n\nI missed the car all right. Also the Southern.  I didn't care much because it wasn't necessary for me to get up until 8:30 to catch the Frisco.  Papa was in a horrible stew.  He was sure I'd been knocked on the head or fallen in the creek.  When I told him I'd missed the car he had another fit.  It's awful when a person gets to be such a prevaricator that people won't believe the truth when its told to them.\n\nI have been cleaning seed to show Grandview tomorrow.  We have about 50 bu of clover seed to sell,I cleaned a peck so beautifully that its simply a perfect sample.  If any body buys seed from us on the strenth of that peck he'll be sorely disappointed when he gets his seed.  I wouldn't spend so much time cleaning it for sale It would be just as good only there'd be some dirt or trash left in it. We have a peck of wheat the same amount of oats and timothy seed to show along with the clover.  They are all extra fine because I spent some three hours cleaning them.  I suppose there'll be a big crowd at the show.  I expect to have a very busy day.  You'd think I was running for office if you'd see me chasing around shaking hands with pe[l]ople and displaying a chessire cat grin.  I will simply be acting as one of the [illegible] committee to show people around.\n\nI suppose you had a fine game of tennis today.  The weather has been ideal if it'll only keep up.  Mary has gone riding on Ben.  We are going to lend a couple of horses to girls in Grandview and then have a riding,contest.  If you'd have come to our fair you might have [illegible] the five dollars for the best lady rider.  You could have ridden Ben.  I am hoping to be one of the judges in that contest so I can tie the ribbon on a [illegible] and then laugh at daddy because his fine hoss got beaten He'd never get over it and Uncle Harrison would simply go straight up.  I fear I'd have to leave home if I did the trick.  I saw an overcoat down town this morning just like I want but I won't get it.  Why? Because it was 75.00.  I can use [illegible],at that price and still have money left.\n\nYou were most awful nice about the other girl but don't suppose there'll ever be one.  If a fellow can pick his idol at ten and still be loyal to [illegible] thirty there's not much danger of his finding another.  One or two of my Aunties and matron friends have sought to arrange things for me several times but could never understand why they never had any luck.  Maybe they will before long.  How does it feel being engaged to a clod hopper who has ambitions to be Governor of Mont. and Chief Executive,of U.S.  He'll do well if he gets to be a retired farmer.  That was sure a good dream though and I have them in the day time even right along the same line.  It looks like an uphill business sometimes though.  But I'm tend to keep peggin' away and I suppose I'll arrive at something.  You'll never be sorry if you take me for better or for worse because I'll always try to make it better.\n\nI am hoping to see you Wednesday evening.  I suppose mamma and I will have to be present at Aunt Susan's grilling.  If she'll only stick to the truth I won't mind but if she does like the rest I sure will hate to be present.  One hates to see a white haired old lady one he likes and respects tearing up the truth just for a few dollars.  It has a tendency to make a pessimist out of a person.  I like money as well as anyone but I think I'd do without it if I had to cast aspersions on my mother's character to get it.  I suppose,you are tired hearing me harp on our old suit but it means so  much to  us if we lose than I can't help it.  You owe me a letter anyway and I hope it'll come early.  You'd better send it if you don't want me to have another spasm in the middle of the week like I did last time.\n\nMost Sincerely\nHarry"

    "content": "[July 22, 1913]\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI succeeded in prying Mary loose from the Nolands in time for the car, although I didn't have much time to spare. Girls always can think of forty things to say at the very last minute. I have Mary fairly well trained though when I came to catching trains. I suppose the girls are coming out to spend the weekend of next week. Mary said so anyway. I think she is intending to have Dr. Lester's family come over on the same day. Won't we have a picnic. I see where I make me a,bed at the farm. It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the bugs. The hay is new and sweet and all the poets say but it is more besides. Poets always fail to mention bugs and snakes. There's one very tiny red bug that ought to be immortalized by Kipling of some other gent who writes jingles. I think that I succeeded in depleting the supply in Mrs. Lester's yard anyway. Those said red bugs always make one so glad they are not as large as grasshoppers or crickets. There really wouldn't be any use in humans trying to live if they were. Can you imagine the size bumps a chigger as big as a grasshopper could make? They don't have them east of the Mississippi. I am wishing most heartily that Mrs. Lester's party had been in Ill or Indiana although I fear very much that if it had been I'd never have gone. Now I don't suppose I could ever induce the hostess to construe that last remark as a com-,pliment do you? It was not meant as it is said for I really had a very nice time. I am sleepy today and Kansas brand chiggers are very industrious so if I say anything to you that has a sound of ambiguity just remember I mean well but I'm not responsible.\n\nI hope the creek will hurry and arrive at the proper stage for us to go fishing. By then I shall be leather-hided and tough enough to resist attacks by any kind of insect in this state. I suppose,we shall have to take some liquid bait along. The kind that Hamlet always labeled \"Danish Snake Bite Cure.\" You know that a fishing excursion is never complete without at least a small bottle. That's what makes the fish that fall back look so large. I have even heard of cases where after using a little of this liquid bait a person could dump his can of worms and catch fresh ones as they came to hand, provided they were not too large. I suppose pieces of pink and purple snakes,would make acceptable hook food for fish. I suppose also it would be well for us to come home by the river road so we can buy a few fish from the fishermen. That also is entirely customary. I am going to bring a pair of khaki overalls for wading purposes. There's no use going to the creek if you can't go into it.\n\nDid you ever see the Madonna in the moon? I imagined I saw her. The proper directions are to think of your girl's countenance and then you can see it. I don't know how the girls are supposed to see it. Probably imagine that they are gazing into a mirror. I'd rather look at the real thing than to hurt my eyes and pain my head gazing into the moon's face. Not that I'd ever have to put forth any effort whatever to conjure up your face because it's always in plain sight. I never see a pretty girl or the picture of one that I don't think, well if she didn't have this im-,perfection or that one why she'd look like Bess. You know perfection can only be reached once. You're it. So what's the use of imagining you in the moon when I can see yourself at Independence.\nThe threshermen won't come today but perhaps tomorrow. I hoped they would come today so I could get to town some day this week but I guess I won't get in. Hope to see you Sunday though. You now owe me a tablecloth-sized letter.\n\nSincerely,\nHarry"

My head is rather thick I suppose.  Anyway, I'm not an expert chauffeur as yet.  It is to be hoped that there will be some improvement by Sunday.  Have had a puncture already, killed the engine times? without number and got the batteries all worn out by running on them.  It is as old man Fred remarked, when you have an auto there is nothing,else to cuss about.  Your mind is entirely occupied cussing the auto.  I managed to get up Dodson hill on high and then killed the engine getting up about a two percent grade.  There is only one thing I can brag about and that is that I can stay in the road.  Got by some thousands of telegraph poles without disaster and then ran over a horse shoe full of nails.  You can imagine the result of that.\n     Have you recovered from the big dose of music?  I made the KCS limited alright.  It was exactly on time and I only waited about three minutes.  Mary arrived the next morning and all she could do was talk music and auto.  She has an insane desire to drive.  She'll soon get it gratified for its not much pleasure to me to drive.

    "content": "Dear Bess: - \n I got your letter this \nmorning and I can tell you\nI most certainly appreciated it\nI am very glad you like the \nflowers and only wish they \ncould have been more\nIf I could have been in \ntown I'd have sent you\nsome fresh ones every day.\nI am hoping that you'll be \nup very soon so I can \nget to see you.  It has \nbeen so long since I last,saw you that it seems like a year.\nIf you don't hurry and get well\nMr. Warfield is going to get by.  They \ntell me that Blanche King is as \nfine as ever at the Orpheum.\nI have finally succeeded in getting \nUncle Harry home.  He remarked when\nhe got here that we was either\nawful sick or awful drunk one.\nIt was a combination.  The doctor\nhas succeeded in getting him\nsober and we hope to keep him that\nway for some time to come.\nI was in the city Saturday and it \ndid seem entirely wrong not to\ngo to Independence anyway.  I \nsent you a little bunch of home\ngrown sweet violets.  They told me that\nthey are more fragrant than the\nCalifornia variety.. I like violets better\nthan any other kind of flowers both to\neat and to look at.  I shall try,and send you some more \nbefore the Week is out.\nWe are having a most lovely\nsnow out this way.  I am \nhoping it keeps up.  Mrs. Chas\nH Lester has asked Mary and \nme to come out there to dinner\ntomorrow evening but I fail\nto see how I'm going to make \nit over roads like they are now.\nOld Liz hasn't been out since\nThursday when I brought Uncle\nHarry home.  This is the \nlongest rest she's had off,sometime.  I've got to put \nher back in the factory.  She\nis suffering from a worse\nknock than ever.  It seems\nthat experts are experts only \nin getting money out of people.\nThey expert an engine all\nto pieces and do it up again \nonly to find it won't run\nany better than it would\nbefore.  They also charged me\nup with 30 hours labor at \n75c an hour.  I don't know,how they got it in as the car\n was only there a day and a half. \nCharging and getting are two alto-\ngether different processes.  I am \ngoing to jaw with them some even\nif I have to pay in the end.\nI am supposed to take active charge \nof the Post Office today but I haven't \ndone it.  The thing is a white elephant\non my hands.  Every person in Grand-\nview who could possibly run the \nthing has asked me for the privilege\nof doing it.  I have had the efficiency\nguy, the poor widow who is the\nonly support of her family, the plain\neasy money one and every other \nhand drawn on me to get the job.\nI have so far turned a deaf ear to\nall of them and allowed the boy\nI promised it to to keep it.  There's\nno telling what I may do if they\nkeep on.  Political promises are no good,anyway and I may break\nmine yet.  I have an idea\nthat I'll simply resign and \nlet em fight it out all over\nagain among themselvfes.\nI am hoping to see you before\nthe week goes by again. When\nyou get well you've simply got \nto give me another picture of your\nself so I can have one downstairs\nand one up.  It's right unhandy\nto chase upstairs every day to see\nhow you look.  Here's hoping to \nsee the original before long.  \nMost sincerely Harry.\n\nPostmark 1915"

Uncle Harry will probably cut me off his will but that can't be helped.  If you still have faith in my poor judgement I can still win.  You know a man's judgement is good or bad accordingly as he wins or loses on a proposition.  It seems to me that it's one big guess and the fellow who guesses right is the man of good judgement.  I am going to keep guessing.  Mamma says that Grandpa Young was cleaned out three times that she can remember but he campu up every time with something else.  This is only once for me but Its a once that I surely hate to contemplate.  I am still hoping the next round of shots will make us a Blue Goose.  These's nothing equals this business for making M.

It is not a very good picture either because it was taken the first day we moved into the building and things weren't very clean around the outside (or inside either). \n\nThe work still piles up. They find something new to do every day. Drill from seven thirty to nine thirty on the guns and all afternoon on horseback. I have written you a letter every night and gave it to a nut to mail and he failed to do it. He gave them to me this morning. You should have heard the cussin he go or rather you should not have heard it. It would have to be edited to go into the Police Gazette. Some of those letters were works of art at the time of their composition but are stale dope now. \n\nYour good letter came last night and I was so near all in I couldn't answer it. When I found you hadn't received all the efforts I put in on Sunday, Monday and yesterday I was so mad I could hardly see. I am awful glad Chas Mize likes his surroundings in F Battery. He is a very competent officer and I think will have something very much better before very long.\n\nDoc Brown says that it is going to be written in his biography that \"he served in but one war\" and that he was in Lawton but once. He and Salisbury and Dexter Perry as we call him are the life of our end of the street.  Salisbury holds Y. M. C. A. meetings and sings church hymns while Doc Brown discusses the events of his varied career. We'll be in the midst of a most serious discussion on how to attack a Hun trench and Perry will nearly break up the meeting with some remark that just hits the nail on the head.\n\nI am supposed to be at Captain Salisbury's equitation class now but didn't show up because I am taking an invoice for the Division Exchange Officer. They kid Salisbury a lot about his riding class. He asked the col. if he should have that equitation \"ridin,\" school on Wednesday and that is what every calls it, the equitation ridin' school.\n\nI almost bought a car load of apples yesterday but they wouldn't take off enough on the price. I am some purchaser. Everyone says ours is the best canteen on the job. Jacobson is some manager. That a grand combination Jacobson and Trumanheimer. Ralph was over see me yesterday but I was out.\n\nIf Mrs. Mize isn't coming til Christmas she might as well stay at home or come to Paris because I think that's where we'll be. Ours is the best guard artillery regiment in the division or the country I think.\n\nHave you discovered what day Miss Rugg is going to have her wedding? Major Gates has been away for three days and I surely ought to be able to get away if he can. Don't you think.

I know I've fallen down on getting my letters off but they were written anyway. I think we will all be glad to have our biographies written along the lines of Doc Brown's. We are going to give Oklahoma to the Germans and call it a bet.\n\nSend some of that cake it never did get bad. It only had 15 minutes to work in after it arrived and it was sure good. I am going to see that Uncle Frank doesn't beat you to the postman from now on if I have to sit up until 3 P.X. to do it. I'll send you some more pictures when they are done.\n\nYour \nHarry,[October 17, 1917]\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI am writing you in the canteen a picture of which is enclosed. It is not a very good picture either because it was taken the first day we moved into the building and things weren't very clean around the outside (or inside either). \n\nThe work still piles up. They find something new to do every day. Drill from seven thirty to nine thirty on the guns and all afternoon on horseback. I have written you a letter every night and gave it to a nut to mail and he failed to do it. He gave them to me this morning. You should have heard the,cussin he go or rather you should not have heard it. It would have to be edited to go into the Police Gazette. Some of those letters were works of art at the time of their composition but are stale dope now. \n\nYour good letter came last night and I was so near all in I couldn't answer it. When I found you hadn't received all the efforts I put in on Sunday, Monday and yesterday I was so mad I could hardly see. I am awful glad Chas Mize likes his surroundings in F Battery. He is a very competent officer and I think will have something very much better,before very long.\n\nDoc Brown says that it is going to be written in his biography that \"he served in but one war\" and that he was in Lawton but once. He and Salisbury and Dexter Perry as we call him are the life of our end of the street.  Salisbury holds Y. M. C. A. meetings and sings church hymns while Doc Brown discusses the events of his varied career. We'll be in the midst of a most serious discussion on how to attack a Hun trench and Perry will nearly break up the meeting with some remark that just hits the nail on the head.\n\nI am supposed to be at,Captain Salisbury's equitation class now but didn't show up because I am taking an invoice for the Division Exchange Officer. They kid Salisbury a lot about his riding class. He asked the col. if he should have that equitation \"ridin,\" school on Wednesday and that is what every calls it, the equitation ridin' school.\n\nI almost bought a car load of apples yesterday but they wouldn't take off enough on the price. I am some purchaser. Everyone says ours is the best canteen on the job. Jacobson is some manager.,That a grand combination Jacobson and Trumanheimer. Ralph was over see me yesterday but I was out.\n\nIf Mrs. Mize isn't coming til Christmas she might as well stay at home or come to Paris because I think that's where we'll be. Ours is the best guard artillery regiment in the division or the country I think.\n\nHave you discovered what day Miss Rugg is going to have her wedding? Major Gates has been away for three days and I surely ought to be able to get away if he can. Don't you think. I wrote checks until my bank account is as weak as Morgan & Co.'s,used to be when I had paid for drilling rig etc. I have taken in about 5400.00 and bough some $9000.00 worth of goods.\n\nI always manage to get back to the canteen no matter where I start to talk.

I had to work until ten-thirty both last night and the night before, and was so near all in that I couldn't write.  As I promised before, I'll not let it occur again.  We are certainly putting in the days here.  They have begun to teach us the English and French methods of artillery fire.  I think we are going to get our equipment very soon.  I hope we are anyway.  They have begun to issue winter clothes.  The boys are sure glad to get them, too.  It is a real summer day today.  The wind has been blowing a gale from the south.  When it gets cold enough, the boys are going to have stoves in their tents.  The colonel doesn't want them put in yet because he says the men are more healthy without them.  I think they are too.  My canteen is still running in its grand, rushing manner.  Some of the other canteens are started now and my receipts have fallen off somewhat.  About three hundred dollars a day is my average.  I caught one of my men stealing money out of the cash drawer night before last and had him put in the guardhouse.  It took me all afternoon yesterday to draw up the charges.  I guess he'll get about two years.  I backed him into a corner and made him admit that he took the money.  He had $10.00 in one pocket and $3.00 in another, and two in another, and three in another.  Did it all in about an hour.  I was at school when the canteen steward came up and called me out and told me about it.  They say the poor fellow is a good soldier but so much money in sight all at once was too much for him.  There has been someone stealing constantly from the till for the last two days.  I suppose he was the guy.  \n\nThere is some talk of our going to Cuba for the winter but I don't put much faith in it.  I think when we leave here we'll go to France.  They have spent too much money here to move us right away; although most of us are willing to give Oklahoma to the Germans and call it a bet.  That part of it that is west of the 100th meridian anyway.  It would be fine if there were no dust storms.  There was one today which makes three this week.  Mrs. Pete came down today.  I haven't seen her.  Haven't seen Pete since noon.  Have you persuaded Mrs. Mize to come down yet?   [illegible] has said he would be willing to go to the hospital if his mother would come down.\n\nI would have gotten this letter off in time for you to get it by S.D. today but Col. Klemm's paw-in-law came down and I had to show him around the camp while the Col. went to school.  He's a nice old man and admired our horses and mules and camp.  Picked the good ones and sorry ones, told me that he'd seen a big herd of antelope right where our camp is and that there is copper in the mountains to the west but not enough to pay.  He lent me some cash registers and said he hoped \"Dutch\" (Col. Klemm) was getting along all right.  I naturally told him that our Col. is the star of the camp and also the most popular man in the regiment, which is all very true.\n\nI writing this in one corner of the canteen because if I go up to the tent some one will come in and want something an away will go my chance to write.  Please forgive me for letting the time to write get away yesterday but I couldn't help it.  I have just been up to my tent and found that your box of good cake just came.  It is sure grand.  Lee said he had never tasted anything so good, neither have I.  It was almost as good as having a letter to get the box with your writing on the outside and some thing real to eat inside.

I have only missed one day writing you and I have written home twice this week.  It seems like I have been here a year.\n\nWas in Lawton today and mailed my letter to you over there.  It is a nice little town, but they have arranged their prices as usual for our benefit.  It seems that the whole country is organized to sell the soldiers at a fair profit plus all the traffic will bear from 40 percent to 100 percent.  I have been cussing the laundries out down here.  They added 40 percent to their prices for our benefit and I told the association over in Oklahoma City just what I thought of it.  They called a meeting yesterday and a committee is coming over to talk the matter over with me.  They got the impression some way that I am the canteen manager for the whole shebang down here and I didn't spoil it.  The way they were charging, it would cost a man fifty-four cents to get a shirt and pants and socks washed.  It doesn't seem right to me for a bunch of stay-at-home plutocrats to take all the money they can get for washing our clothes.  When a man does a day's work drilling he doesn't feel like doing a night's washing.  The outfit have already offered to take off 25 percent, but they've got to do better or we'll do our own washing.\n\nI also tried to buy a carload of pop from the Coca Cola bottling works in Oklahoma City and Lawton.  They refused to let me have more than fifty cases.  I wired the Seltzer bottling works in K.C. to take care of us because we are a Kansas City organization, and they referred me to the Coca Cola bottling works of Oklahoma City.  So there is another combination in restraint of trade.  I'm not going to sell pop.\n\nI suppose you are tired reading of my storekeeping experience, but I have nothing more to write about at present.   Captain Allen, Lee and a couple of boys from the first Kansas have been paying us a visit and I couldn't finish my letter.  Mize and Kelley are as well pleased with us as they would be at home in their own organization I think.  They are both fine fellows and very competent.  Our own \"babies\" Hale and Clark are very unhappy where they are.  Olney, their captain is a nut and some one is going to punch his head some day.  Clark and Hale are both good soldiers though and I think they will learn something even if they do have a hard time.\n\nCol. Rumboldt was up and sampled the Puritan at my place yesterday.  He's very fat and I've an idea that Old Crow or \"Bud\" would have suited him better.  I have sold 800 bottles of Puritan this week\nand wasn't allowed to sell any this evening because the men had another shot in the arm today.  I wish you could see the swarm around my place of business at about 7:30 P.M.  \n\nI took some pictures today and if they are good will send you some.  They call me Lieutenant Trumanheimer now instead of Graballsky.  You may just address my letters as usual because if Father Tiernan, who sorts the mail, came across a letter from you addressed that way, I'd never hear the end of it.\n\nHere's hoping tomorrow will be another grand day.  Had a letter from Mary today too.  Remember me to your mother and all the rest of the family and yourself first, last, and all the time.\n\nYour Harry,Oct 5 '17\n\nDear Bess:\n\nAnother fine day—got your letter of yesterday.

Our own \"babies\" Hale and Clark are very unhappy where they,are.  Olney, their captain is a nut and some one is going to punch his head some day.  Clark and Hale are both good soldiers though and I think they will learn something even if they do have a hard time.\n\nCol. Rumboldt was up and sampled the Puritan at my place yesterday.  He's very fat and I've an idea that Old Crow or \"Bud\" would have suited him better.  I have sold 800 bottles of Puritan this week and wasn't allowed to,sell any this evening because the men had another shot in the arm today.  I wish you could see the swarm around my place of business at about 7:30 P.M.  \n\nI took some pictures today and if they are good will send you some.  They call me Lieutenant Trumanheimer now instead of Graballsky.  You may just address my letters as usual because if Father Tiernan, who sorts the mail, came across a letter from you addressed that way, I'd never hear the end of it.\n\nHere's hoping tomorrow will be another grand day.  Had a letter from Mary today too.  Remember me to your mother and all the rest of the family and yourself first, last, and all the time.\n\nYour Harry,[cancellation stamp: Lawton Okla Oct 6 6 PM]\n\nMiss Bess Wallace\n219 Delaware St.\nIndependence\nMO.,[cancellation stamp: Independence MO Rec'd Oct 7 1917 7 30 PM]"

    "content": "Lawton, Okla. \nOctober 3, 1917\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThis is the banner day of my stay here so far.  I got two letters from you.  One of them was postmarked the twenty-ninth, and the other the second.\n\nI was on the point of wiring you but was afraid it would cause you more worry than gladness and so I didn't do it.  I slipped up a day on writing you but couldn't help it.  You no doubt got my spasm from the Lee-Huckins written on Sunday night.  Monday was my most strenuous day.  I began having callers at eight-thirty and from then on until twelve-thirty salesmen nearly ran me ragged.  At two-thirty I got a car and began making the rounds, trying to buy some pop and get into connection with a laundry.  Pop seems to be unobtainable.  I could only get fifty cases and I wanted a carload.  The laundries have formed a combination and advanced the prices 40 percent for our benefit.  I told them that we would do our own washing.  It would cost fifty-four cents to get a shirt, pants, and socks washed.  Colonel told me to send the laundry to Kansas City.  I am hiring a man here in the Battery to do mine.  After I'd seen the laundries and wholesale house to the tune of seven dollars worth of auto hire, I had to run to catch my train back here and get into camp at 12:30 a.m.  The canteen is a whiz.  I did four hundred dollars worth of business today.  It gets bigger all the time.  Sold six hundred bottles of Puritan in two hours this evening.  It takes six men to wait on the trade and keeps me phoning all the time to keep in supplies.  I am writing this at 11:30 p.m. after my day is over.  We had a grand time yesterday selecting our mounts from the issued horses.  There were one thousand to pick from and we took turns on precedence.  I am the seventh first lieutenant from the top and had a grand allotment to pick from.  Picked a sorrel with a flax mane and tail.  He proceeded to pile three men on the ground one after the other.  I am going to get another horse to rest up on when he gets done with me.  It was like a bunch of six-year-old kids turned loose in a candy shop when those officers were told to select their mounts.  The chaplain was given first choice.  He picked a beautiful black with one white hind foot.  Everyone was offering him advice but I don't think he needed any.  We all had lots of fun and I think everyone is happy with the choice he made.\n\nI can't understand why you haven't had my letters.  I have written one to you every day but yesterday.  All our mail goes to Lawton and then comes over here, and I suppose they haven't their system properly arranged as yet.  \n\nDon't you give any thought to what that rotten sheet at 17th and Grand says about us.  We have an ideal camping place good water and plenty of it; will have electric lights in a few days; have to [six] much to eat good beds to sleep on and our hospitals are going to be palaces when completed which will be very shortly.  They are not needed any way as no one has been seriously sick except a fellow who got too familiar with one of these plug's heels, and he's only got a cracked rib.  They sent him to the Post about two miles away which has a hospital as fine as R.A. Long's or St. Joseph's.  Our doctors have less to do than any of us except the horse doctors.  I guess the horse doctors will be pretty busy very shortly though.  It looks as if we meant business by getting our horses so soon.  I understand that guns are on the way.  I'm tickled pink to hear you are going to see Mrs. Klemm.  She's sure nice.  \n\nMy hat is too small really after what Mrs. Montague said.  You know that's some compliment from a mother of boys.  I appreciate and only wish I could live up to it.  I am awful glad Frank is free to do as he likes.  I was uneasy when I heard he'd been called.  Wish I could have gone to the river with you.  I'm awful glad you saw Mamma and Mary and that they were well.  I have had a letter from Mary and two today from you and one from you Saturday. \n\nDon't forget the picture for I'm sure lonesome to see you.  Thank your mother for her love and give her mine if there is any left from you.\n\nYour Harry,Lawton, Okla. \nOctober 3, 1917\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThis is the banner day of my stay here so far.

The canteen opened up last night with cigars and tobacco.  I bought twenty barrels of Puritan and sold it by noon today.  Then bought fifty barrels more.  My sales today amounted to nearly three hundred dollars.  Not a bad day's business for a new man in a new town, what?  It has nearly run me wild though getting started.  The major doctor has my building and won't move.  I have to use a tent.  When he moves out I'll have a store that will make Emery, Bird's look like a jay-town store.\n\nWe have an excellent camping place as I told you before.  The Col. remarked to me last night that it looked as if we'd made the choice ourselves.  Maj. Gen. Wright is in France and Gen Berry our Brigade Com is now in Command of the Post.  That makes Col. Klemm Brigade Commander until Gen Wright gets back.\n\nThe 128th Regiment (1st Mo. FA) is West of us and 130th is East (1st Ks).  We are right under the General's nose because he will have quarters right in front of us.  I had to make a trip to Lawton today to get some things for the canteen.  It is something.  No one seems to know who is in business there or where things can be found.  But they are very accommodating.  I told one old fellow over there that I wanted to buy a cash register and he said he had seen one for sale a week ago and he went and called up the place for me but the machine was gone.  Mr. Lee says he wishes he had a girl to write to.  I informed him that I have the finest one in the whole world and I'm sure homesick to see her.  The two second Lieutenants in all the Batteries were transferred to other organizations.  The ones in A to B, the ones in B to C and so on down the line.  Ours went to A.  I suppose we'll all go the same way soon.  The Col says he wants a regiment and not six batteries.  I'm for him if he says so.  Have to be.\n\nSend me a letter as often as you feel that way and (a picture) make it as long s you can.  Wish I'd been at the river with you.\n\nHope Frank will be blind the day of the exam.

Father Tiernan has charge of the mail now and we are getting letter service. He was over to see us this evening and was very entertaining. He was telling about an English recruiting office insulting a priest in Kansas City and what he'd have done to him had he been the priest. I guess he'd have done it too.

The weather has been as fine as it was unpleasant yesterday. If your letter had come it would have been an ideal day. We had gun practice this morning and I fired a problem (theoretically) and was very highly complimented by Major Gates and Captain Allen. Went riding this afternoon and taught some rookies how to sit on a horse and then went to officers riding school and learned a few things myself. Got on a horse that trots like a Ford and had myself jolted into a good appetite for supper. Had a grand supper too - cherry pie and everything. Then school for an hour and a half and nothing to do till 5:45 A.M. tomorrow when I get up and take reveille and repeat the whole performance. Tomorrow is inspection too and we have to have a shave on our faces washed for the Colonel to look at. Shoes are supposed to be shined but I doubt if mine will be. They look as if they had cost 98 cents instead of $10.00. I think I'll wear my boots and spurs they are as good looking as ever. My Dutchman or rather our Dutchman for he works for Captain Allen, Lt. Lee and me, keeps them all polished up. He went riding this afternoon and I asked him if he learned to ride in the horse marines and he said he did. He served 5 years in the German Navy. He's plum nuts over Captain Allen as he calls Pete. Says he'll join the Navy if Pete is transferred from our Battery. Pete's the best Captain in the Regiment. This Dutchman washes our clothes shines our shoes and saves us money generally. I haven't paid a laundry bill since we've been here. The laundries raised their prices 40% for our benefit. Patriotism by practice is their theory. So is it Lawton's. Houses that formerly rented for $11.00 a month are now $27.00 etc. ad lib. $1.00 shirts are $3.00 and everything in proportion. We don't buy from them or patronize them at all. I buy everything for our bunch at wholesale. I had a letter from Myra and one from mamma today. Myra sent me a picture of an American soldier and a French girl and admitted that she didn't think it would work in my case but she'd send it anyway and I could give it to someone else.

Some lowdown infantrymen or good for nothing regular artillery man stole our dog Casey. He wore about $11.00 worth of harness and was a brindle bull as ugly as any picture of one you ever saw. The ninth section (our roughnecks) are going to clean up on someone if they can find who took him.

I hope he does anyway because I'm going to hit him another crack.  Please keep on sending me a letter once in while.  Every day if you feel like it.  I am awful glad that you and Mrs. Mize are backing Mrs. Klemm up.  She seemed to be very much wrapped up in the Assn.  \n\nI will write you later in the day and then perhaps I'll feel better.\n\nYours always,\nHarry,[cancellation stamp: Lawton Okla Fort Sill Br.

I wouldn't have you think for anything that I was stringing you along about coming home to Nellie's wedding.  I was the most thoroughly disappointed person you ever saw.  It didn't even occur to me that I'd be turned down, because I had a job for the divisional canteen officer to perform in Kansas City.

The colonel went over and ask General Berry himself to let me off and there was just a curt no for an answer.  A first lieutenant who has been attached to us and who has been in the Philippines for the last five years asked for a ten-day leave to go see his mother, who has three boys in the army, and General Berry turned him down without comment.  They are letting no one go home.  I thought that by working regimental business and pulling wires to get a job for the division I could surely get away for three days but, as you perhaps know, couldn't.  Your remark hit a very tender spot because I have not been so completely disappointed for some time.   I was willing to bet a month's salary Tuesday morning that I'd be in K.C. Wednesday and there were no takers.  The boys all thought I had a cinch, so did I.\n\nWe all went equitating this morning rode about fifteen miles with the Colonel in charge. He was very happy this morning and took us on a real ride instead of a drill. He was all sore about something yesterday though. Every Saturday isinspection day and we have to clean up. Usually he inspects the Canteen at about 10 o'clock (The Colonel does the inspection) but yesterday he came in on me at nine. I happened to be ready for him. He looked all around and then said \"Well how the - did you get this place so clean\" and walked out. Capt [illegible] told me that he (the Colonel) was intending to step on me proper but this was no excuse. \n\nYesterday was my busy day. I had a case in the general Court. They tried one of my thieves. Convicted him but I don't know how hard for the court won't tell until the Judge Advocate General of the division reviews the findings of the court.

I told Miss Mayer I would wear them down the streets of Paris with low shoes. I certainly appreciate them and shall only wear them on state occasions or Divisional Parades.\n\nThis was a fine day I got a letter from you. We have been having fine spring weather all week. I am scared it's only a weather [illegible] as we have never gone this long before without a storm. I am now Battery Mess Officer which adds a few more hours to my day. I have a grand time,keeping my money, the Battery money, the canteen money, and money the men give me to keep from getting gloriously scrambled. I have $863.80 on my desk for change besides enough more scattered around in different places to make $1000.00. I count on it about an hour every morning and sometimes it's right and sometimes not. More often not.\n\nI am going to raise sand (which isn't hard to do down here) with our mess sergeant today because I don't like him no how and he has his books mixed up. Don't forget to tell me what to get for Miss Nellie's wedding present. They are still joshing me about my trip to Kansas City. Ask me how I found 12th Street and all,kinds of questions like that. We have schools of all kinds now from School of Fire to how to write the Brig a letter. You know it is necessary to unreel about seventeen yards of red tape when you want a Divisional Pass and one is necessary now to go away from here over ten miles. You have to request your Bty Com. [Battery Commander], the Commanding officer of the Reg and then the Brig. It takes nearly all day. I don't ask for any. About the only way any of us will get to see our home folks is for them to call on us. Write me real often, I am always happy when your letters come.\nYours always,\nHarry.,"

We had a gorgeous dinner, turkey, cranberry sauce, fruit, cake, pie, etc., ad lib.  The Duvalls were all here and seemed to have a very pleasant time. Several of the boys, sisters, cousins, aunts and sweethearts were here and I am sure they will take away a very fine impression of Camp Doniphan, the Star to the contrary notwithstanding. I would have been absolutely happy if you'd been here or I'd been there either of which arrangements was impossible.

Less has been lending me a sweater like that for a month and the Government never has any warm gloves. We are going to have a new commanding officer very soon.

Sill for ten weeks and then join us in France if they make good, which both of our Cols will undoubtedly do. Most of us have had the blues on account of their leaving, especially those of us who are in right at headquarters. They tell me that our new commander is a hard cookie. His name is Danford. He is a Lt. Col. of Artillery and has written a book on the subject which we have been using as a textbook. They boys have been reading it very religiously since they heard he is coming here. Col.

I'll admit that our mail service is bum all right but it is improving and I hope that very soon it will be perfect running order. Father Tiernan is in charge and has built himself a fine tent to work in. Mr. Lee and I have our tent boxed up now and it is like living in a house. The floor is bright and new and shows the dust awful plain but I think we'll soon have it black enough so that will be remedied. Our dust storms continue with charming regularity. Some of the natives are of the opinion that they will quit but I doubt it. Mary sent me a box of fine cakes yesterday and another today. I had a regular party. It was just like flies around a sugar bowl. The Col. and Lt. Col. were among the flies too. They feed us fine but things from home sure taste good.\n\nWe received our full quota of drafted men yesterday. The regiment is was strength now. They are a fine bunch of fellows. Most of them are big huskies from Missouri farms. Some are from St. Louis and Kansas City. They seem to be as well satisfied as could be expected. They all have fine big overcoats and O.

I'll admit that our mail service is bum all right but it is improving and I hope that very soon it will be perfect running order. Father Tiernan is in charge and has built himself a fine tent to work in. Mr. Lee and I have our tent boxed up now and it is like living in a house. The floor is bright and new and shows the dust awful plain but I think we'll soon have it black enough so that will be remedied. Our dust storms continue with charming regularity. Some of the natives are of the opinion that they will quit but I doubt it. Mary sent me a box of fine cakes yesterday and another today. I had a regular party. It was just like flies around a sugar bowl. The Col. and Lt. Col. were among the flies too. They feed us fine but things from home sure taste good.\n\nWe received our full quota of drafted men yesterday. The regiment is was strength now. They are a fine bunch of fellows. Most of them are big huskies from Missouri farms. Some are from St. Louis and Kansas City.,They seem to be as well satisfied as could be expected. They all have fine big overcoats and O.

I wrote you Friday night at midnight and failed to connect last night because I went to bed at 9 o'clock.  I had to take reveille this morning because I am Battery Officer today therefore I had to go to bed early.  Yesterday was sure a fine day and I put it in too.  We have inspection every Saturday morning by Colonel Klemm and I have to get the canteen in apple-pie order.  We had things in fine shape inside but he kicked like a bay steer because the Puritan distributor hadn't returned for his empty bottles.\n\nI have a Jew in charge of the canteen by the name of Jacobson and he is a crackerjack.  Also the barbershop is run by a Jew, Morris Stearns by name.  He formerly owned the Ridge Barber Shop, does yet but the guy he left in charge is stealing the income because Morris says he gets nothing from it.  What I started to say was that the Col inspected the barber and everything was shipshape.  Morris had it all scoured up and shining like a new pin.  The colonel couldn't see anything outside to kick about so he made Morris open his cupboard doors and then he said, \"Just as I expected, you simply stuffed the dirt out of sight.\"  The rest of the bunch sure rawhided Morris.  \n\nI have been unloading a car of soda pop today.  About 670 cases of it.  We closed up at noon to get it all put away.\n\nMrs. Klemm came down yesterday afternoon.  She sent for me this morning to ask me to urge you to take part in her association on the 129th Aux.  I told her I'd sure do it and I am.  She's very anxious to have all the Independence bunch take a hand in it.  I told her I was sure they would if you did.  You will won't you?  She seemed very anxious about it.  It seemed to me that she'd been weeping about something when I was at the Col's tent this morning.  I don't know whether she had or not but I thought she had.  Maybe the Col had told her we were going to France right away.\n\nWhen I started to the stables (we now have them) this evening to oversee the feeding it was too hot to wear a coat.  When I came back it was as cold as the very dickens and dust so thick you couldn't see ten feet away.  It is blowing a gale now right from Medicine Hat.  I expect it will be about zero in the morning because I have a carload of pop ready to freeze up and bust.  It so dusty in my tent that I came to the tailor shop to write this.  The tailor, the barber, Jacobson, the regimental mess sergeant and my bookkeeper are playing penny ante and having a hilarious time.

I took in $100 before dinner today, which makes about $450 in two days and a half, with nothing to sell but tobacco and Puritan and a few apples.  I'd rather own that canteen than the trapshooters.  We called a meeting of the Battery commanders today (we means me and the colonel) to make up a fund for the canteen from the Battery funds.  Olney and Sermon and one or two others had so much to tell me that I finally got disgusted and asked Captain Jobes if he would lend me three thousand dollars on my John Henry to start one and he said, \"You doggone bettya.\"  I then told the outfit that I didn't want their blooming funds.  The colonel wasn't present and when he learned what I'd done he simply reared up on his hind legs and threw a fit.

Did I tell you that they simply dislocated all the principal inner workings of Lizzie?  Busted the universal joint and some other contraption whose name I never heard all to pieces on the first trip out.

Nothin' but Indians in Lawton, and ugly ones at that, so you have no reason for thinking that anyone else but you ever enters my thoughts.

The lecture was on shoes and what goes into them, and how to make a soldier walk farther than he can. I nearly went to sleep but I guess I got something out of it. We dug trenches yesterday afternoon about five miles west of here and got wet coming in. What do you think of that for a country that hasn't had a rain in two years? It also rained last night. Came down in sheets. This morning is as fine a spring morning as you'd care to see.\n\nI told the whole canteen force they had to go dig yesterday and they went. It nearly killed the barber and the tailor. The tailor said there was some difference between a number 10 needle and a number 2 shovel.\n\nWe had some inspection this morning. The colonel was all wrought up. Made everyone do setting up exercises until they were black in the face. I got the canteen all rigged up and he never even came around. I've got to eat up our mess sergeant because our kitchen had some dust on one two-by-four alongside the stove. Knives and pots and pans,have to be polished and shined like a Christmas tree. Yesterday was a grand day in spite of the rain because I had a letter from you and one from home.\n\nMrs. Klemm was here yesterday. She sure thinks you are fine. I think so too so we had a fine agreeable conversation. I am hoping you can come to see me before we have to go to Mineola, New York, or some other shipping point. There are all sorts of rumors running wild down here about going to France in six weeks, but I don't pay any heed to them until I am officially informed, which will no doubt be at least two days beforehand. I have a chance to get this mailed special delivery and will have to quit.

I have just finished getting out yesterday's receipts.  We got about $800 yesterday.  The refinery is bought and so is another 200-acres lease adjoining it with some nine producing wells.  Your shares now have 1,500 acres of deeded land and 1,300 acres of leases at Chanute, besides a 200-acre lease in Allen County and a contract for 5,000 acres in Sumner County, Kansas, and 5,000 acres in Garfield County, Oklahoma.  The money is coming in by the basketful and it looks as if the Atlas Okla. Lands Syndicate should be in the pictures before many days.  I'm afraid to be glad for fear something will drop.  I was just as sanguine over a certain hole in the ground location at Commerce, Oklahoma.  If this venture blows, I'll know I'm hoodooed.  I don't want to be a bloated plutocrat, but I would like very much to have enough to tell my creditors to take my liabilities off the books and then have something left over.  As old man Holmes would say, just enough for a country place, a machine or two, and a couple of new dresses a year for the lady.  I'm going partners within it all.  That's not an extravagant wish, is it?  If some hard knocks and a little overwork will accomplish it, I hope to win.  There's one thing, my mother is for me, first, last, and all the time--and I know you are.  Why shouldn't I win?

    "content": "Westgate Hotel\nKansas City, Mo.\nMay 27, 1917\nSunday night\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThe train was late.  It didn't arrive until ten-fifteen.  Should have been in at nine.  I didn't call up because I know you don't appreciate midnight calls.  This letter should have reached you at ten o'clock this morning but the one I had written sounded so badly that I didn't send it.  In fact it was both blue and mushy.  They don't go well together or singly.  This one may be as bad before I'm through.  If it is, I won't send it either.  I have written you dozens of epistles you have never seen.  Whenever I'm particularly happy, or particularly the opposite, an insane desire to tell you about it possesses me and I write you about it.  Generally I'm never half so badly, or so well, off as I at first thought, and you are therefore not worried with knowing what a very erratic and unstable person I am.\n\nYou know, I have been badly disappointed today.  That dad-blasted mine has been sold twice and has come back to me both times because the brother of the man who owns the land the thing is on happens to own the adjoining mill and wants my mine to run through it.  (Can you comprehend that Dutch statement?)  There is a Bertha M. Clay plot connected with the thing.  The men from whom  the magnificent Mr. Culbertson made his purchase are bitter enemies of the Commerce Mining & Royalty Co., the richest outfit in the Oklahoma mining district.  The Royalty Co. owns the land.  The people we bought from owned the lease.  Now the lease is going to quit very shortly and I had been led to believe that I could get another if the mill were running.  I went to see the president of the Royalty Co. yesterday and he told me that he was of the opinion that he'd let his brother run the dirt from that mine through his mill, which is the adjoining one to mine and called the Lost Trail.  My sale fell down because he said that, hence my happy feeling this evening.  I still hope to arrange another lease because the former Grandview banker whom I never cared for very much is going to work for the Royalty Co. in the capacity of cashier of their new bank.  I hope to be able to hand him a line of conversation that will cause him to make Mr. Robinson see me on this lease.  (Robinson is the Royalty Co.'s president).  Maybe he can; maybe he won't.  If not then it's the sheriff for the mine, unless I can ring in our friend J.S. from Ardmore.  He hates mines and at present seems to love oil.  Hope he stays that way except in one instance.  \n\nI seem to have a grand and admirable ability for calling tails when heads come up.  My luck should surely change.  Sometime I should win.  I have tried to stick.  Worked, really did, like thunder for ten years to get that old farm in line for some big production.  Have it is shape and have had a crop failure every year.  Thought I'd change my luck, got a mine, and see what I did get.  Tried again in the other long chance, oil. Still have high hopes on that, but then I'm naturally a hopeful, happy person; one of the \"Books in brooks, Tongues in trees, and Good in everything\" sort of guy. Most men are liars--I'm one myself on occation (I'm not sure but that's sion)--and they all are where there's money in it.  I was very, very impressionable when I was a kid and I believed all the Sunday school books and idealist dope we were taught and it's taken me twenty-odd years to find that Mark is right when he says that the boy who stole the jam and lied about it and killed the cat and sassed his ma, grew up and became a highly honored citizen and was sent to Congress, is absolutely right.  The poor gink who stands around and waits for someone to find out his real worth just naturally continues to stand, but the gink who toots his horn and tells 'em how good he  is makes 'em believe it when they know he's a bluff and would steal from his grandma.\n\nI don't believe that.  I'm just feeling that way now.  If I can't win straight, I'll continue to lose.  I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have you to love and to know that when I've arrived at a sensible solution of these direful financial difficulties I've gotten into, that I'll have the finest, best-looking, and all the other adjectives in the superlative girl in the world to make the happiest home in the world with. Now isn't that a real heaven on earth to contemplate?  I think it is and I know I'll have just that in the not far off future, unless it is necessary for me to get myself shot in this war--and then I'll still find you somewhere.  I dreamt that you and I were living in Rome when togas were the fashion.  I am always dreaming of you.  I'm never anywhere in a dream or out of it that I don't imagine you there, too.  Last night I thought I was in an airplane in France.  I fell about 17,000 feet and didn't get much hurt and I was idiot enough to weep because I couldn't see you in the hospital.  It seemed that you were outside and they wouldn't let you in.  Some dream, what?  (I had a cheese omelet for supper.)  I'm going to eat one every night.\n\nYou'll sure enough be bored when you get this if you do.  But I just had to have a conversation with you.  I can never say what I feel when I see you and anyway when a hardheaded American  citizen gets to spouting his heart actions in Laura Jean Libby periods he just simply feels like an idiot and I do, but I mean all I've said about you and I'll keep hoping that J.S. Mullen stays by us till we get a gusher--and I can really show you how much I care.\n\nHope to see you right soon.  Will have to go home tomorrow night to get a new set of collars, etc., as my grip has all second-handed ones.  Can I come over Tuesday night?  Just remember how crazy I am about you and forget all the rest.\n\nMost sincerely,\nHarry,Westgate Hotel\nKansas City, Mo.\nMay 27, 1917\nSunday night\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThe train was late.

This letter should have reached you at ten o'clock this morning but the one I had written sounded so badly that I didn't send it.  In fact it was both blue and mushy.  They don't go well together or singly.  This one may be as bad before I'm through.  If it is, I won't send it either.  I have written you dozens of epistles you have never seen.  Whenever I'm particularly happy, or particularly the opposite, an insane desire to tell you about it possesses me and I write you about it.  Generally I'm never half so badly, or so well, off,as I at first thought, and you are therefore not worried with knowing what a very erratic and unstable person I am.\n\nYou know, I have been badly disappointed today.  That dad-blasted mine has been sold twice and has come back to me both times because the brother of the man who owns the land the thing is on happens to own the adjoining mill and wants my mine to run through it.  (Can you comprehend that Dutch statement?)  There is a Bertha M. Clay plot connected with the thing.  The men from whom  the magnificent Mr. Culbertson made his purchase are bitter enemies of the Commerce Mining & Royalty Co., the richest outfit in the Oklahoma mining district.  The Royalty Co. owns the land.  The people we bought from owned the,lease.  Now the lease is going to quit very shortly and I had been led to believe that I could get another if the mill were running.  I went to see the president of the Royalty Co. yesterday and he told me that he was of the opinion that he'd let his brother run the dirt from that mine through his mill, which is the adjoining one to mine and called the Lost Trail.  My sale fell down because he said that, hence my happy feeling this evening.  I still hope to arrange another lease because the former Grandview banker whom I never cared for very much is going to work for the Royalty Co. in the capacity of cashier of their new bank.  I hope to be able to hand him a line of conversation that will cause him to make Mr. Robinson see me,on this lease.  (Robinson is the Royalty Co.'s president).  Maybe he can; maybe he won't.  If not then it's the sheriff for the mine, unless I can ring in our friend J.S. from Ardmore.  He hates mines and at present seems to love oil.  Hope he stays that way except in one instance.  \n\nI seem to have a grand and admirable ability for calling tails when heads come up.  My luck should surely change.  Sometime I should win.  I have tried to stick.  Worked, really did, like thunder for ten years to get that old farm in line for some big production.  Have it is shape and have had a crop failure every year.  Thought I'd change my luck, got a mine, and see what I did get.  Tried again in the other long chance, oil. Still have high hopes on that, but then,I'm naturally a hopeful, happy person; one of the \"Books in brooks, Tongues in trees, and Good in everything\" sort of guy. Most men are liars--I'm one myself on occation (I'm not sure but that's sion)--and they all are where there's money in it.  I was very, very impressionable when I was a kid and I believed all the Sunday school books and idealist dope we were taught and it's taken me twenty-odd years to find that Mark is right when he says that the boy who stole the jam and lied about it and killed the cat and sassed his ma, grew up and became a highly honored citizen and was sent to Congress, is absolutely right.  The poor gink who stands around and waits for someone to find out his real worth just naturally continues to stand, but,the gink who toots his horn and tells 'em how good he  is makes 'em believe it when they know he's a bluff and would steal from his grandma.\n\nI don't believe that.  I'm just feeling that way now.  If I can't win straight, I'll continue to lose.  I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have you to love and to know that when I've arrived at a sensible solution of these direful financial difficulties I've gotten into, that I'll have the finest, best-looking, and all the other adjectives in the superlative girl in the world to make the happiest home in the world with. Now isn't that a real heaven on earth to contemplate?  I think it is and I know I'll have just that in the not far off future, unless it is,necessary for me to get myself shot in this war--and then I'll still find you somewhere.  I dreamt that you and I were living in Rome when togas were the fashion.  I am always dreaming of you.  I'm never anywhere in a dream or out of it that I don't imagine you there, too.  Last night I thought I was in an airplane in France.  I fell about 17,000 feet and didn't get much hurt and I was idiot enough to weep because I couldn't see you in the hospital.  It seemed that you were outside and they wouldn't let you in.  Some dream, what?  (I had a cheese omelet for supper.)  I'm going to eat one every night.\n\nYou'll sure enough be bored when you get this if you do.  But I just had to have a,conversation with you.  I can never say what I feel when I see you and anyway when a hardheaded American  citizen gets to spouting his heart actions in Laura Jean Libby periods he just simply feels like an idiot and I do, but I mean all I've said about you and I'll keep hoping that J.S. Mullen stays by us till we get a gusher--and I can really show you how much I care.\n\nHope to see you right soon.  Will have to go home tomorrow night to get a new set of collars, etc., as my grip has all second-handed ones.  Can I come over Tuesday night?  Just remember how crazy I am about you and forget all the rest.\n\nMost sincerely,\nHarry,[Printed Letterhead] \"Follow the Searchlight\" Westgate Hotel A Room with a Bath for a Dollar and a Half at the Junction on Main and Delaware at Ninth Kansas City, MO.\n[Stamp] Buy a Liberty Loan Bond inquire at any bank or post office\n[Cancellation Stamp] Kansas City May 28 1917 MO [/Stamp]\nMiss Bess Wallace\n219 Deleware St\nIndependence MO"

It has been three days since I wrote one so I guess I shouldn't make any fuss about it, but you don't know how pleased I am to get your letters. When the post office boy brings one of them down here he always gets all the candy, apples, and pop he wants. There's never any delay after they arrive here. I have written three letters home in the last two weeks and they haven't received any of them. At least I had a letter from Mary yesterday and she did not write as if she had heard from me for a month. I sent her a wire Wednesday and got an answer to that. I guess they must be holding up our mail. I am,going to take this one to Lawton and mail it myself. I was hoping to see you Saturday. A whole bunch of K. C. people were down visiting their friends and relatives. Boxley and Ferson were both down. I sent you a Battery picture by Ferson. I am mailing you a picture of the officers of the 129th. They all look fine and fat especially the second one from the left end. I went out and stayed all night in the trenches Thursday night and all day Friday. We put on a real imitation battle. It was pretty cold sleeping on the ground but I don't think it hurt anyone. I felt better the day after than I did the day before.\n\nThey have been auditing the canteen to see if they can send me to jail but I reckon they won't catch me this time. I showed a profit of $5560.00 for sixty day period, which isn't so worse,considering that I have only a $5000.00 stock.\n\nMr. Lee, Father Tiernan and I went over to Major Gates for dinner this evening and we sure had a fine time. Lee and I had been over before and Mrs. Gates was out for dinner on Friday and I asked her if I could bring Lee and pay our party call and she said \"yes, come to dinner.\" Father Tiernan was standing by and got himself included and we had a nice party.\n\nI met the Col just as I was leaving camp and had a new suit of woolen O.D. that old man Marks made after I left. He made me take off my coat and then went and ordered one like it. He said he couldn't expect all his Lieutenants to dress that well until they had had a chance to run the canteen a while. I have lost about ninety dollars of my own money in the,devilish thing making change to I guess they wouldn't buy many clothes.\n\nI hope you can come down some time soon. The Col. talked like there might be a slim chance of my going home Christmas for a few days but I don't put any faith in it.\n\nJacobson has gone to Okla City and I will have to stay close to the canteen tomorrow and watch my cash.\n\nMamma and Mary are coming down Friday. I'll sure be glad to see them.\n\nI hope that Christmas Mass will be a fact.\n\nTell your mother that I am looking for the right kind of a fellow to get her box. It is a hard matter to pick them out because the ones that are worthy of it are so stiff necked and I can't find out about,them and the other kind do not deserve anything. I am investigating a case now that will fill the bill I think. Will let you know as soon as I can.\n\nThere isn't any gossip or scandal that I know of down here that would make good reading anyway. I am so darned busy I don't know what goes on half the time.\n\nWrite as often as you can for I am sure happy when your letters come.\n\nYours always,\nHarry,[printed return address]\nONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINTH                                                                                                              [stamped postmark: \"LAWTON OKLA., DEC. 11, 2-30P, 19\"]\nFIELD ARTILLERY\n\n\n                                                                                                 Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                                 219 Deleware St\n                                                                                                 Independence\n                                                                                                                             Mo,[stamped postmark: \"INDEPENDENCE, MO.

Colonel Klemm made us a speech on our duties to God and country, and Lieutenant Colonel Elliott made one on the duties of an artillery officer.  They were both from the shoulder and gave us something to think about.  I had thought somewhat on both subjects, but not as far as these gentlemen went.  According to them, we have placed ourselves on a position of placing the American Government above everything, even our lives.  We are expected to do absolutely as we are told.  Evidently, if we are ordered to go to Berlin, go we must--or be buried on the way.  \n\nI hope Russia saves us the trip, although I'd like to be present when Berlin falls.  I tried to call you up this evening hoping that perhaps I'd get asked over to dinner tomorrow but I had only one chance at the phone and it failed.  Maybe I can have better luck in the morning.  I thought about you all evening, as I hope this letter proves.  It was absolutely necessary for me to be present, as the colonel gave us our commissions from the governor.  I am going to give you mine to keep because it may be very valuable to someone--at least I hope it will.  I have felt like a dog all week.  It seems that I have caused you to be unhappy by my overenthusiastic action in getting myself sent to war.  Two big tears came in Mamma's eyes last night when I started off to Lodge in my soldier clothes.  You are the two people in the world that I would rather see smile and that I like to cause to smile, and here I've gone done the opposite to both of you.  Perhaps I can make you all happier for it.  I'll try my best.  Some way I seem to have an ability for getting myself into things by my overzealous conduct or anxiety to see them a success and do not seem to see the consequences to myself or others until the conclusion comes.  The Joplin mine is a shining example.  My brilliant farming experience is another.  Just the other night when Major Klemm gave his battalion a banquet for making him major, I arose in my zeal and fulness of heart and announced that I was for him for colonel; for Captain Elliott for lieutenant colonel; and for Captain Miles for the new major.  Someone chased right off to Major Stayton and informed him of my brilliant speech and he ceased speaking to me.  I didn't care, for I'd have informed how I stood if he'd asked me but I shouldn't have been so loud in my remarks.  Since Stayton got beat all along the line there's no harm done because he can't reach me now, but if he'd won either high office I sure would have caught the dickens.  Maybe a little war experience will tone me down and make a man of me.  I hope it will anyway.\n\nBess, I'm dead crazy to ask you to marry me before I leave but I'm not going to because I don't think it would be right for me to ask you to tie yourself to a perspective cripple--or a sentiment. You, I know, would love me just as much, perhaps more, with one hand as with two, but I don't think I should cause you to do it.  Besides, if the war ends happily and I can steal the Russian or German crown jewels, just think what a grand military wedding you can have, get a major general maybe.  \n\nIf you don't marry me before I go, you may be sure that I'll be just as loyal to you as if you were my wife.  I'll not try to exact any promises from you either if you want to go with any other guy, why all right, but I'll be as jealous as the mischief although not begrudging you the good time.  \n\nBess, this is a crazy letter but I'm crazy about you and I can't say all those nutty things to you without making you weep.  When you weep, I want to.  If you'd looked right closely the other night, you might have discovered it, and a weeping man is an abomination unto the Lord. All I ask is love me always, and if I have to be shot I'll try and not have it in the back or before a stone wall, because I'm afraid not to do you honor.\n\nSincerely,\nHarry,Densmore Hotel \nKansas City, Mo. \nJuly 14, 1917\n\n11 P.M., Saturday night\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI have just finished the Regimental Banquet.

It was sure fine and I am most awful glad to get it. I was very much disappointed because I didn't see the sender, because I thought perhaps you might surprise me by coming down. I expected to see you really and it was some disappointment when I didn't. The candy was fine. Mr. Lee got a box of cookies and some candy, too. We could have had a feast all our own if we'd wanted to.\n\nKelly is the happiest man in camp I guess except Rice Pendleton and C. Bundschu. I asked Mr. Bundschu when he was going back to heaven today and he said he wasn't going he was going to stay here as the thought this was nearer heaven than Independence. Some people have queer judgment in some things. I'd sure like to have a chance to go to Independence and Grandview. I don't think mamma got my letter asking her to come down because I had one from Mary telling me they couldn't come,[printed letterhead; image Cross Cannons. \"ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINTH, FIELD ARTILLERY\"]\n\nand she never said anything about my letter.\n\nLizzie has a cog wheel or something cross ways in her interior workings and refuses to budge. So I can't haul Mrs. Dunn around much as I would like to. Anyway her son has a car so she will get all they riding that is necessary. Mize and Flynn and one or two others took Capt. Sermon's car out Thanksgiving day and pinched for speeding on the horseshoe. The horseshoe is a fine rock road running around the camp. Only military cars can ride on it and they can't go over 15 miles an hour.\n\nSass Dickinson is back. He didn't get a commission at Ft. Sheridan. I can't understand it either because I know a couple of bums who did get commissions and who don't know enough to come in when it rains.\n\nI went to church last Sunday with Lee down to the 128th Artillery and it was Episcopal. I intended telling about it sooner but Lee insisted that I only went because,[printed letterhead; image Cross Cannons. \"ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINTH, FIELD ARTILLERY\"]\n\nI wanted to write you about it and so I didn't do it. F Bty has been out to the trenches again today and I went along. The canteen is going to be invoiced, inspected and audited tomorrow. Some job.\n\nI have been trying to think if I've failed to answer any questions I should have or have not told you all I know but I think I've done both except that I took Roger Sermon's wife horseback riding last Sunday. He wasn't along either. Hines and his wife and Capt Pete and his were though so I guess it was perfectly proper. I had an invitation a dance last night at our hospital but I didn't go because all the partners were married women and their husbands were all present. Anyhow Lee and I have so much to do that we can't be bothered with a dance. I told Mary S. B. that you wouldn't let me dance until the war is over and I shouldn't be surprised if you hear it so I'd better tell you now. I am looking for a long fat letter tomorrow and next day and I do hope it won't be in vain. If you only know how well I like to get them. Wish I could see you Sunday.\n\nYours always,\nHarry,[printed letterhead; image Cross Cannons. \"Headquarters, ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINTH, FIELD ARTILLERY\"]\n \n                                                                                                                                            [stamped postmark: \"LAWTON, OKLA., DEC 1, 230PM (1917)\"]\n\n\n                                                                                                                       Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                                                       219 Deleware St\n                                                                                                                       Independence\n                                                                                                                                                  Mo,[stamped postmark: \"INDEPENDENCE, MO., DEC 2, 8 PM\"]"

I am dizzy tonight from counting money but I am going to write anyway. I handled seven thousand dollars in change and never lost a penny. Mamma sent me a baked chicken and it is sure fine. Things seem to be showering in all at once. I had a letter and a picture from you yesterday and a letter and a chicken from home today. Tomorrow is Mamma's birthday. I wired Boxley to send her some flowers and I guess he will. I am urging her as well as you to come down Thanksgiving.\n\nWe had orders today as to what we can take to Europe. I don't know if that means we leave soon or not. Rumors fly thick and fast but none of them are worth a snap unless there is an order with them. Traveling salesmen nearly took my place of business today but I didn't buy anything but some hat cords and chin straps. Today was inspection as usual on Saturday. Last Saturday I got,all shined up and the Col never even came around. I went and told him about it and he said he'd get me some day when I wasn't ready so I got up before breakfast this morning and shined up the place as it was never shined before. He didn't come around until about ten o'clock and then he had Switzgable of the Commerce Trust in Iowa and he didn't do a thing but brag how nice it was and what a fine canteen and barber shop he had. Col Elliott and Mike Pendergrast also paid me a visit and remarked on how clean things looked. You know when the canteen's clean it does excite some comment for it's usually topsy turvy. I have a barker who sells chances on things that are too high priced to sell over the counter and there is a mad scramble for cakes and pop and Puritan and it looks like a feminine bargain sale all the time only the purchasers wear khaki. About 10 PM on Wednesdays and Saturdays I am generally about as tired as if I'd followed a plow all day and as hard and impolite as a paying teller in a National Bank. I have a rule in the barber shop making everyone wait outside and Stearn the head barber says he's got so in the,habit of saying \"Wait your turn outside\" that he'll tell his customers that when he goes back to his shop in the Ridge Bldg.\n\nIf the war continues for a year or two, we'll all be hard cookies. Won't you please come down and knock off some of the rough edges? Jacobson says he'd go into the guardhouse thirty days for one night on Twelfth Street.

    "content": ",Lawton, Okla. Nov. 24, 1917\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI got your picture last night and I have had such a wide smile ever since that everyone has remarked about it. It is sure a speaking likeness and I really can't tell you how glad I am to have it. Unless you'd come yourself you could have sent me nothing that I'd like better.\n\nOtto has just handed me your letter and I admit that I deserve a call-down but I can only plead work from 6:00 A.M. till 10:00 P.M. We had a payday Wednesday and you can guess what that meant to me. I counted money until my head ached. Changed five thousand dollars in ten-dollar bills in about a day and never lost a penny. Today I had to go to the trenches and dig or see to the digging and also have some timbers cut down. We are under the direction of a French officer and actually playing a real war game. It is very interesting but also very hard work.\n\nThe piano you have asked me about so often and which I have failed to tell you,about (because I didn't know myself) was drawn by someone out on the south side of Kansas City. I can't remember the name because I've never heard it but once, but I'll find out from the first sergeant of the supply company and tell you. If there are other questions I've left unanswered, it's by accident and not intention. The pictures are not done, because picture paper is not obtainable, so the photo man tells me, but we are expecting them any day.\n\nThat's a grand rumor going the rounds and I hope its time I'll do my best to come home Christmas if I'm not in Mineola N.Y. or Savannah Ga or somewhere else loading men and supplies for France. Tom McGee started the rumor down here that Gen Berry wouldn't let me go home to my own wedding on the seventh and I have an idea that Hines or Bostian wrote it home and someone has fixed it up to suit the occasion and as I think it should be. To be honestly frank though I've come to the conclusion that Gen Berry wouldn't let one of us go home to his own funeral let alone a grand oc-,casion like his wedding. Our new mess sergeant is sending you an invitation to be present at our Thanksgiving dinner and I do wish you could be. I am figuring on every line of talk there is to get me loose for a trip home but I doubt very much if I can make it.\n\nYesterday and today have been very grand days both because your photo and letter came. In fact yesterday is really a reckoning day, one to which I can refer as the day on which I received something that I most highly prize. I hope I have not failed to answer everything I should. Tell your mother I am looking for that man and will send her his name when I have found one that will properly appreciate the nice package she will send.\n\nWrite me as often as you can and come to our dinner if you can. Had you have come down the other day, you'd not have had to be any waitress or waiting maid either nor would I have done any dodging.\n\nYours, \nHarry,[printed] \n      HEADQUARTERS\nONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINTH\n        FIELD ARTILLERY\n\n                                                                             Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n                                                                                  Independence     \n                                                                                                              Mo.,[postmarked: \"INDEPENDENCE NOV 25 10 AM MO\"]"

I think I named over the various jobs I have to perform in my last and I am trying to make them all hit. So far I don't think there's more than one cylinder missing on each job. I am getting to be a hard boiled cooky if things don't go to suit me someone gets an awful currying. The mess Sgt. of our outfit has succeeded in getting the kitchen everlastingly balled up and Pete elected me to untangle it.\n\nPete is making the best Battery in the Regiment. He stands ace high with the powers that be and also with his men. Tom McGee is also making a fine Captain. We go out to dig trenches again in a few days. I understand that we get to fire our battery from these positions. Hope so anyway.,Today is payday and I have $5000.00 in change on my mind. It is in the Adjutant's safe but two men and pick that up and carry it away. Col. Klemm sent for me last night and told me he would steal it himself if he got a chance. The Govt pays in $20 and $10 bills and every soldier in the regiment comes to the canteen to buy 5 cents worth of candy to get change.\n\nThose pictures are not finished but as soon as they are I'll send one to you. They had to be made in Oklahoma City. I am of the opinion that we will get to stay here at Christmas. I have put in for leave to go home but I doubt if I get it. Everyone is plum crazy to go home and I have an idea that the higher ups will get off if anyone does.\n\nI am looking every day for that picture so hurry it up.

Your name sure looks good on a letter head and I'm glad you sent me a copy of the stationary.  Bill Bostian is certainly lucky to have forgotten his gloves but I'm afraid it has spoiled one of my pet superstitions for him, that is that it is unlucky to turn back when you start any where.  I am very glad to learn of Frank's recovery and I sincerely hope that no one else has taken the \"Flu.\"  It has never struck our regiment although some of the others have been badly hit by it.  We seem to have been a lucky outfit in more ways than one.  You must have had one glorious celebration on the 11th and I'd have certainly liked to be present although we had a right good celebration ourselves of extreme quiet after 11 o'clock and it was greatly appreciated, that extreme quiet, I'll tell you.\n\nI stopped in Paris again on my way back to the regiment and went to the opera, the real one, and heard Thais.  It was beautifully put on and well sung.  The building was worth the price of admission to look at.  Major Gates and I went. The rest went to the Casino de Paris to see a gaiety show, which, they said, was very good.  Paris has a thousand streets more or less and no two of 'em run in the same direction, nor do any of them have the same name from end to end.

Your name sure looks good on a letter head and I'm glad you sent me a copy of the stationary.  Bill Bostian is certainly lucky to have forgotten his gloves but I'm afraid it has spoiled one of my pet superstitions for him, that is that it is unlucky to turn back when you start any where.  I am very glad to learn of Frank's recovery and I sincerely hope that no one,else has taken the \"Flu.\"  It has never struck our regiment although some of the others have been badly hit by it.  We seem to have been a lucky outfit in more ways than one.  You must have had one glorious celebration on the 11th and I'd have certainly liked to be present although we had a right good celebration ourselves of extreme quiet after 11 o'clock and it was greatly appreciated, that extreme quiet, I'll tell you.\n\nI stopped in Paris again on my way back to the regiment and went to the opera, the real one, and heard Thais.  It was beautifully put on and well sung.  The building was worth the price of admission to look at.  Major Gates and I went. The rest went to the Casino de Paris to see a,gaiety show, which, they said, was very good.  Paris has a thousand streets more or less and no two of 'em run in the same direction, nor do any of them have the same name from end to end.  Nearly any old street in a small village sports a name for each end of it and in Paris they have from two to a dozen.

I think I shall mail this at Rock Island, Ill. That is where we are going to eat supper. They have been kidding me pretty strong today because I called you out of bed to the phone. Major Gates said he expected to see in the society column where you were engaged to someone else because of it. I told him not to worry his head about that. It was not a very pleasant thing from your point of view,[printed letterhead; image Cross Cannons. \"ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINTH, FIELD ARTILLERY\"]\n\nI don't suppose to be called out at that unearthly hour, but it gave me lots of pleasure to hear your voice once more even if it was only over the phone. Besides it may be a whole year or more before I'm in Kansas City again and if it had been two o'clock instead of five I'd have done it. I am sorry to have disturbed your mother but I hope she'll forgive me this time. There is only one chance that I won't go to France and that is a strict eye test at the post of embarkation. I guess I'll get by though. We only stayed in K.C. about,[printed letterhead; image Cross Cannons. \"ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINTH, FIELD ARTILLERY\"]\n\n twenty minutes and I spent fifteen of that hunting a phone. I do wish I could have seen you. I suppose Mary will have a fit when she finds I was in town and didn't call up. There were no Home phones in a mile. We were over in Armourdale in the Rock Island yards and one Bell phone in the yardmaster's office. I am terribly thankful it was there and that it was a Bell.

One also came this morning which you had written at the employment bureau. It is surely a good thing that bureau if you have given all those people employment. You should keep it open for returned soldiers after the war. I know that expects you to get him a job. I fear there is no chance of a leave because more rumors are floating around about the oversea leaving.,The Irish are having a big time today. It is a grand day for it too. If this brand of weather were usual here we could almost be happy. The Irish Bty, \"D,\" gave a banquet last night and from what I hear they had a grand time. I went to Lawton with Col. Klemm and Col Elliott to see Col Klemm get his 3rd degree. That makes two Cols of this regiment I have helped over the square and compass goat and it doesn't seem to have made them dislike me either. Our new major commander isn't so worse after all. He sat on General Berry the,other day, and I am for him strong. The general told him to examine some second lieutenants for firsts. He asked the general if he expected them to know as much as a regular army first lieutenant. General said yes. Major Waring said, \"All right I vote no on every one of 'em. I can't waste my time on a bunch of cockeyed lieutenants that are not professionals so I'll just kill 'em now.\" General then told him to fix up any kind of exam he saw fit. So he fixed one they could pass. I understand now that our promotions are indefinitely held up because there are no vacancies. I am glad for I'd rather go to Europe a lieutenant than a captain on this special detail. I can't plead guilty to having taken anyone horseback riding last Sunday but my orderly. He and I rode about twenty miles out to a copper mine and to Medicine Park. The mine looked like the one I already own so it wasn't very enticing. I hear indirectly that Morgan and company has a gusher camouflaged in Texas and is trying to lease the whole northeast corner of the state. I hope so. I'd like to be a millionaire a few days before I go to Europe so I'd be used to it when I come back. I sure appreciate your letters and I'm crazy to see the box. Will write immediately it arrives.

    "content": ",Somewhere in France (Still far from the front) July 31, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nYour letter of July 5 came today and I, as usual, had a fit of gladness. I hope you had a good Fourth but I know it couldn't have been a glorious one with the death of your grandfather so close to it. I do wish I could be there to help you decide whether you'd stay in a huge house or a small one. It wouldn't take me two minutes to decide.\n\nI am going to buy you an iron cross or German helmet or something like that and send it to you as soon as I can get where they are for sale. You can tell 'em I captured it or anything you like. Most war trophies are bought afterwards or picked up on the field after the battle. Nowadays battles are just sort of a \"you shoot up my town and I'll,shoot up yours.\" They say that Americans don't play fair. They shoot 'em up all the time. I hope so because I want to finish this job as soon as possible and begin making an honest living again.\n\nMy Irish Battery went out on the range the other day and outfired the others in the battalion, on account of which I am rather swelled up. The major remarked that \"D Battery is all right\" and then he proceeded to tell the others why they weren't. I was awfully lucky and they say that a smiling face goes a long way toward getting things looked on in the right way. Anyway, I feel right encouraged. As I told you before, if I am a success as the commanding officer of a Battery of field artillery I shall have accomplished the best thing I could do in this war. I have my doubts about my bravery when heavy-explosive shells and gas attacks begin. I am like a fellow Uncle Harry used to tell about. I have the bravest kind of head and body but my legs won't stand.,I hadn't the slightest notion that I was causing you a heartache when I wore my uniform to the party last Fourth. I was so proud of myself for having it that nothing would do but I must wear it. I wouldn't make you an instant's unhappiness for all the glory in the world. But I've got to put my ability (if I have any) to its very best use now so we can really enjoy our great country and real happiness when it's over. I am sure you wouldn't want me to be anywhere else than where I am now.\n\nI certainly appreciate your putting a star on the church flag for me. I believe in all churches, even the Roman Catholic can do a man a lot of good. I had a Presbyterian bringing up, a Baptist education, and Episcopal leanings so I reckon I ought to get to heaven somehow, don't you,think so?\n\nI have had more letters the last few days from unexpected sources. An old oil stock salesman who used to borrow money from me to get whiskey on sent me a fine letter and one of my good neighbors who never seemed to appreciate me at home sent me another. I guess I must be doing something besides cheat that \"E Pluribus Unum\" \"In God We Trust\" government out of $200.00 a month to go to school on.\n\nI am hoping most sincerely that they don't send me to the SOS or home before I get one chance at the front.\n\nIt is sure a great game if you don't weaken. Be sure and write to me as often as you can, because I think of you always and can never tell you how much I do think.\n\nYours always Harry\n\nHarry S Truman Capt. 129 \nFA American E.F.,Harry S Truman\nCapt 129 FA\nAmerican E.F.\n\n                                                                                 Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n[stamped:\"A.E.F.

    "content": ",Angers, France \nJuly 7, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nSunday and sunny France sure enough. It feels exactly like Independence or Grandview would on the 7th of July. We are having very warm and very dry weather. It is fine for harvesting the crops but rather uncomfortable for long walks and strenuous drill. I'd rather see it through than have it cold as it was when we first came over.\n\nThe regimental band has just been giving us a serenade and I sure enjoyed it. They played some regular American music just like they did on the 4th when we had our grand celebration and track meet I told you of.\n\nMajor Gates, Captain Thatcher and I went into Angers to dinner last night,because we wanted to give our battalion mess cook a Saturday afternoon off. We had from soup to nuts in a little French place that probably has fed some celebrities in its time. It is run by a large fat woman who speaks English almost and who endeavors to give American officers her best at a percentage on regular prices. (Not reduction you understand.) Anyway she has the best French cooking I've eaten. Major and Capt Thacher were horrified when I told them that the very best meal I ever tasted in France was the one of stewed tomatoes and stewed prunes on the side that I got when I returned to the regiment from school. Mike Flynn happened in and the Major,asked him to sit at our table. He ordered ham and eggs and coffee which is also considered a sacrilege in a French restaurant when you can get lobster, roast capon and much other good for nothing junk cooked up with a Louis XIV flavor that doesn't appeal to me.\n\nWe go into town on a cute little narrow gauge railway that has a little wind up engine and coaches about the size of a Ford limousine. It's easy enough to get in about 5:30 but you've either got to buy an interest in a taxi or walk out. It's nine kilometers or about five miles in civilized distance so we usually buy the interest. There are only three taxis in town, the rest having been requisitioned by,government and it is necessary to make arrangements early. It is also the reason it costs 40 francs to go 9 kilos. You can pile on all the thing will hold for that but no reductions are made for fewer passengers. It's the same for one or seven.\n\nWe went to a French picture show at the Grand or National Theater. Every town has a big show house where they put on operas, plays and picture shows. Saturday night is picture show night. They had an American film play translated into French. I know all the actors and [illegible] but couldn't tell head or tale about their performance except that it was the usual three cornered mellerdramer. We had to leave in the midst of the show because our taxi was dated,up for ten P.M.\n\nI felt right romantic riding down alleys that Henry of Navarre, Mary di Medici or Richlieu had once graced on horseback and considered very fine streets. Two automobiles have to maneuver for quite a while to pass in most of them. There's one boulevard call Le Boulevard di Saumur which is a real street but the rest are just as they haven for 1000 years.\n\nI haven't had a letter for a week. Guess the mail boat is held up. I am going to school again this week but it is a regimental one so it won't be so bad. It is about 100 miles from here and in the direction of the United States. It takes a long time to get to the,front but I guess we'll get there some time.\n\nSaw Bill Bostian yesterday. He looks fat and healthy and is also a school teacher. He belongs to the suicide squad or machine guns. He came in just as I was taking up the regimental school so I did not see him but five minutes. He'd come down to see Kenneth but Kenneth was away at school. Bill caught the next train and went on to the school where Kenneth is. He had a gold service stripe on his arm and seemed to be very happy and enjoying life.\n\nKeep writing for I sure enjoy a letter or a bunch of letters from you.\n\nYours always,\nHarry\nHarry S. Truman Capt. 129 F.A. Ajt 2n Bn. American E.F.,"

    "content": ",Angers France\nJuly 4, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nJuly 4 and in France. Last 4th about this time of day 6:30 PM I was coming into your yard with a brand new uniform with a cap a crop and silver spurs. I thought I was about it as a first Lt that day having lead the first platoon of Bat. F in a Swope Park parade. Now I don't amount to a drop in a very large bucket and I'm a captain and the adjutant of a whole battalion of artillery. Things can happen pretty fast in one year. I hope the Germans will be driven to the Elbe by next 4th and I'll be home and still a captain with honor. It's hard to keep it over here. I've never worked so hard in my life just to keep from getting sent home as a bonehead. If I can only get to the front for the grand drive,and the great finish I can hold my head up the rest of my days anyway and maybe feel that I tried to do my share even if I don't win any honors. Wish I could walk in on you this afternoon and get some of those tomatoes and beans and things you are working so hard to raise in your garden. We get them over here but you can't expect an army cook even if he is the best to make things taste as your mother and your sweetheart can. No it hasn't rained for a long time has been beautiful sunshiny weather until yesterday. There was a shower and I was in it. Today is a beautiful as the proverbial one in June that's so [illegible]. The regiment has been having a field meet. Foot races, jumps tugs of war and a ball game. There's a chateau close by with fine grounds. It was an ideal place,for a picnic and we had a dandy band and all. I nearly ruined my voice yelling for the second Battalion officers. When we had a tug of war against the first Battalion. Had Pete for an anchor on our side and flipped a coin to see whether I'd get Col. Elliot or Col. Klemm, won Elliot and had Crenshaw, Flynn, Lawson a fine athlete from the south and a Lt in Bat F and three other husky Lieutenants. Paterson, Col Klemm, Capt McGee Major Wilson and one or two other heavies were run in on the other side. It was eight to eight. First thing we did was to put a stick in the picket line they were pulling with and give them the word to pull. The stick broke and let the whole sixteen fall in a pile Cols underneath as was intended. Then we hooked them up right and I never saw such a pull for two minutes. It was decided as a draw but our Batallion pulled em a foot and held them there. The Colonels and the Majors then went to tea given by the General to the Prefect of this district. The Major just returned and said that there was a Countess and a Dago Princess there. I left the picnic in the midst of the ball game so I could write you a letter. It was real exciting. F Bty had the lead over D Bty by runs in the 5th inning. I hope F won. I hope to send you a picture of the place where we went to school next time I write with my charming phiz in the midst of it. I am also having some postcards done in my go to h- cap Sam Brown harness and everything. Be sure and keep writing. You've no idea how I watch for them.\n\nYours always\nHarry\n\nHarry S.

    "content": ",Angers, France Sunday June 30, '18\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThe Major and I have been paying a formal visit and a dine out to the Major of the 1st Bn and his Adj Capt Paterson.\n\nThey had the regimental band and the Mayor of the town in which they are billeted along with most of the inhabitants of the surrounding community. The performance was to have come off last Sunday but the band got its dates mixed up and failed to show up. It was positively side splitting the way the thing occurred. Paterson has a doctor friend (French) who has a pretty daughter, who is engaged to a French Major at the front, by the way, and who has a pretty girlfriend that Paterson likes to try out his French on. The Mayor also has a couple of very pretty daughters, also unattached and Paterson con,ceived the idea of informing the Mayor that he was having the band down and the Mayor could invite the community if he so desired. All this was to take place last Sunday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The Mayor invited his community bought a barrel of wine for the band, several bottles of wine (Champagne) for the Major \"le Commandant\" and \"Le Capitan Paterson\" beside investing in three bouquets about as big as a bushel basket, one to be presented to the band, one to Major le Commandant Miles and one to his Adjutant Le Capitan Paterson. Paterson invited his French doctor, the doctor's daughter and her lady friend and things were all set for one magnifique time.\n\nThe band came over and played for us about 2 o'clock and about 3 a truck came out from Angers to take them in to play for some hospital dedication or other. I asked them,if they expected to play for the 1st Bn and they said no they guessed not as the Lt Col had ordered them to town. Well I had some business with Pat and I jumped on my bike (you should see me ride a bicycle) and went over to transact it. Found him taking a siesta. He got up and told me how glad he was to see me and told me all about his grand band concert that he was going to have in about an hour. I told him the band had gone to Angers and wouldn't be out any more that day. It was like a thunder bolt. He hopped into his blouse and harness and hiked over to Regimental Hqrs about a mile away in nothing flat and he's fat too. He couldn't find the Colonel the band or anybody else. He came back, nearly sweating blood because there was the mayor, his daughter, and all the community besides the doctor and family to hear that band. Then there was the Mayor's wine, the Mayor's bouquets (one of which was to come to Pat), and no band. Pat could only get gales of laughter and hard words from me and the rest of the officers. I never saw anyone in such agony. He must have sweat four gallons. I didn't stay to see how he patched it up but he pulled it off today, wine major doctor daughters bouquets and all. It was very nice but last Sunday was funnier. To top it all off the band went to Angers and played for some kid performance on the other side of town from where they were supposed to go, so everything ended up in moving picture style. It's getting so dark I can't see and as there are no electric lights and candles are not much good, I've got to quit. I told you about visiting the palace of the Dukes of Anjou and seeing a piece of tapestry that had a crosseye saint on it and looked like a dirty table cloth and being worth $100000.00. I'm enclosing a picture of it. Keep on writing. They are coming better now.\n\nYours always\nHarry\n\nHarry S.

We are having the time of our innocent young lives lookin' out the window up Broadway. We got here at Camp Merritt at eleven-thirty last night. They assigned us quarters and we put in a very pleasantly cold night. Got up this morning, had breakfast of ham and eggs at a cafeteria in the camp, and then got permission to come to the city. Got a taxi, five of us did, and drove thirteen miles to,130th Street, rode the ferry across, and then began hunting for the subway downtown. They told us it was only a block from the ferry. We walked around and hunted and finally decided to take the elevated, which was nearby about four stories up. Well the elevated turned out to be the subway! The devilish thing runs out of the ground about 120th Street and runs over a low place on stilts. We couldn't recognize it as the subway. We have all had shines, shaves, baths, and are now in here to go to church somewhere this,afternoon. We haven't decided whether it will be Al Jolson or George Cohan. I have an idea we'll flip a coin and decide. Camp Merritt is a cantonment with steam heat, hot baths (when there's a fire) and private rooms for officers. We missed the boat and may have to stay a week. That will be awful, won't it. As it is we don't have to go back to camp until 4:00 P.M. tomorrow (Monday)\nThey are waiting on me and I've got to run.

Also a box of candy from Paris on which it said it was sent by order of Miss Bess Wallace, Independence, Kansas City, Mo. It was grand candy, too, and very much appreciated because candy is hard to get. I guess they sent the candy instead of the cake because cake is under the ban. All flour is used in bread. The candy was just as well and lasts a heap longer. I have been working as usualâ€\"the regimental schoolteacher, along with Captain Patterson. You should hear me hand these fellows bunk and make them like it. It's rather funny for an old rube to be handing knowledge (of a sort) to the Harvard and Yale boys, but it's happening now. The hardest work I ever did in my,my life too. I'd rather saw wood or pitch hay. You can never tell what will happen to you in this war. May be a farmer superintendent before it's over. They say that if you can't pass an exam in trig. and logs, they'll keep you on the horse lines and won't let you up front. I hope it's only a rumor.\n\nYour dream was sure a fine one but I could never teach West Pointers anything. I might teach some B.N.A. outfit how to do squads east or squads west but its not likely. I had a good dream myself a few nights ago. Thought I was in Independence all diked out with stripes of service and bars of rank and celebrating the grandest event a man can. I never saw you look so pretty as you did in that white get up except in that black velvet dress with one suspender. Now can I have two letters this week?,I was mighty sorry to hear of Rufe Montgall's death. Hadn't heard until I got your, and Mary's, letters. He was a fine boy and his mother's only child. The French say, \"C'est la guerre.\" One old lady over here had eight sons killed. She asked that the ninth one be sent to the reserves. Her request was granted but before the order got there he was also killed. They are stoics though and are satisfied to give all for the principle they are fighting for.\n\nI'm for the French more and more. They are the bravest of the brave. If there were only millions more. They and the Americans hit it off fine. The people we are billeted with seem unable to do enough for us. They appreciate the least friendliness and if I had the time I could learn French from them. But I don't know any more now than when I landed. Too much artillery to learn.\nNo I haven't seen any girls that I'd care to look at twice and when I'm happiest I am dreaming of you, so that ought to be the right and proper condition of mind, oughtn't it not?

    "content": ",Angers, France June 14, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI am back with the regiment and a sure enough captain. Have been, it seems, some six weeks. I'll have about a bushel and a half of francs back pay coming next payday. I reckon I can go out and have a real time with it. I just barely slipped through the artillery school, as did some of the others. One or two made names for themselves and were promoted out of the regiment as instructors, which means that they'll be second lieutenants until the end of the war, and that they'll not get to the front. I am very glad that I didn't make any such record. I am the adjutant of the Second Battalion, 129th F.A. A right hefty job and one that gives me precedence over all the Battery captains, even if they do outrank me. I've got to organize,a regimental school and teach the balance of the officers what I learned (which won't be a whole lot) .\n\nI had another grand trip across France coming back to the regiment. It is certainly a beautiful country. They wouldn't let us go to Paris but I saw Orleans and the famous statue of Joan and a beautiful Cathedral that has been standing about a thousand years.\n\nThe railroad runs right down the valley of the Loire the famous dividing line between the ancient factions in French politics. You know all south of that river were for Henry of Navare and all north of it were Catholic. This town is the capital of ancient Anjou of which one of the brothers of the King of France was always Duke .\n\nThere is a castle here that Mary de Medici was imprisoned in and from which she made a very dramatic escape only to be caught again right outside of it. There are also,many beautiful chateau around here. Salisbury as was to be expected is quartered at one. I am going into town today and see what it's like.\n\nWe are billeted around at little villages with French people and I hope to learn some French. Major Gates and I have two grand rooms at a little wayside inn. The beds have canopies over them and a step ladder is needed to get into them. The floors are of tile and not very pleasant to stand on without any shoes. The regiment is scattered all over five square miles. I nearly walked my legs off paying visits to various places where the batteries are quartered. Col Klemm, Col Elliott and everyone is here except Captain Olney.

    "content": ",[March 25, 1918]\n\nDear Bess:\n\nYour telegram and letter were both waiting for me when I returned from New York this afternoon. I was in on strictly business today. Bought two pairs of glasses which makes me six pairs so I don't suppose I'll run out.\n\nI accidently ran into an honest optician who happened to belong to my goat tribe (ie Scottish Rite) and he sent me to the best or one of the best oculists in the city. He gave me a complete and thorough examination a prescription I can use in Paris or Vienna and lots of good conversation all for the whole sum of $5.00 and then he asked me if thought I could,stand that. How is that for the crookedest town in the universe? Then the optician who also gave me lots of good advice only charged me $17.50 less 10% for two complete pairs of regulation aluminum frames and glasses, throwing in an extra lens that he happened to chip on the edge in the grinding. I can't understand it. Watts stung me for $22.00 for two pairs and Dr. Leonard charged me $10.00 the last time I bought any and they were supposed to be friends of mine, too. This place is on Madison Ave. just off 42nd St. and I know he pays more rent for a week than Watts does for a month. Evidently these men are patriotic even if one of them is named Haustettee. That's the optician's name and he says it loses him business although his son has made some wonderful,inventions in observing instruments for the U. S. Navy since we went to war. I sent you a small package today for Easter. I hope it arrives intact. When you wear it think of me out on the Atlantic thinking of you and seeing your face in the moonlit waves of Old Neptune, and wishing, wishing oh so badly that I could only see you. Really I'm almost homesick for you & mamma & Mary. If I could only have stayed these two days in Kansas City instead in this kike town I'd have felt much better. I am crazy to leave because I know that if the British stem this tide there'll not be another and I do want to be in at the death of this \"Scourge of God.\" Just think what he'd do to your great country and,our beautiful women if he only could. This is the reason we must go and must get shot if necessary to keep the Huns from our own fair land. I am getting to hate the sight of a German and I think most of us are the same way. They have no hearts or no souls. They are just machines to do the bidding of the wolf they call Kaiser. Old Julius Caesar's description of the [illegible] exactly fits the Germans of today and to think that Wilhelm should call himself Caesar. Attila or Tamerlane would be nearer the truth.\n\nAs I told you before I've seen this town from cellar to garrett and from the Battery to the North End and I can't do much for it. When a New Yorker shows you the Woolworth Bldg or,Sen. Clark's house or Grant's Tomb or the Hudson River he expects you to fall death with admiration and if you don't he's confident your education has been overlooked. When one of our N.Y. Lieuts showed me Grant's Tomb from the Hudson Ferry I did him like March Twain did the dago who showed him the paintings of Michaelangelo. I said, \"Well! Is he dead.\" The nut didn't even think it was a joke. He thought I wanted to know sure enough. Anyone from west of the Mississippi can make these people believe anything. I believe I could sell gold bricks on Broadway and make 'em cry for more.\n\nI shall try my best to find,White's and spoil a photographic plate if it will please you. This is Wednesday evening and Friday we leave so I don't know whether I can make it but I'll try.\n\nDon't you worry about me not taking care of myself. I'm not out for V.C.s or Croix de Guerre. I'm going to use my brains, if I have any for Uncle Sam's best advantage and I'm going to aim to keep them in good working order, which can't be done by stopping bullets.\n\nAgnes must want my fine plug pretty badly, but she doesn't want to pay what he's worth. He has a pedigree that would make the King of Spain green with envy. He's worth $300.00 for a saddle horse and being himself he's worth $500.00. If Agnes wants to make an offer like that I,might listen to it. Although I promised Col Danford that I'd keep him until the war is over and let him have him if he wants him. That was the only way I'd take him because it would have been stealing to buy him for $100.00. Agnes must think I want $50.00 mighty badly. I do need it and badly but my grand saddle horse isn't for sale. This letter is not what it should be but I'm trying to make up for what I didn't do at Ft. Sill. I hope you'll forgive me because my intentions were the best but I was trying hard to make good for Uncle Sam. I did down there and if I can only hold up on the other side perhaps I can do him and you and everyone some small service.,A telegram just came from Gates Wells to know if I can see him. I shall try to meet him at the McAlpin tomorrow if he can come up there and I can get away. It's fine of him to want to see me. Tell your mother I love her almost as much as I do my own and if you ever throw me down I'm going to call her mother anyway. I'll write you tomorrow and wire you Friday.\nI shall cable you direct when I land. My cable censor address is Boxley and I can cable oftener because it's about Â½ the cost. Keep on writing to the same address the letters will be forwarded.\nYours always,\nHarry.,[printed return address]\nONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINTH                                                                                                              [stamped postmark]\nFIELD ARTILELRY\n[printed return address]\n[illegible] Det 35th Division\nCamp Merritt N.

It couldn't even play at the Globe and get by in Kansas City. New York is a very much overrated burg. It merely keeps its rep by its press agents' continually harping on the wonder of it.

The priest or someone evidently gets up in the tower and plays a regular tune on them. The church has two bells and after beating on them drum-style for a while he comes downstairs and rings them a half-hour church-style. He's been doing that ever since 5:00 a.m. at two-hour intervals. We'd be happy to see those bells melted into cannon, I tell you. We won't have,to be bothered by them for more than one Sunday more though because I fear they are going to send us to our regiment next week . I hope so for I've worked x-y=bvd until I'm plum dizzy. I've passed all the exams but one and I got 40 in it so I guess they won't send me home for inefficiency yet.\n\nI've learned more in the last four weeks than I did in all my time in high school.\n\nWe went to a YMCA picture show the other night out on the public plaza of this village. It was evidently one of the first ever staged but it looked mighty good to us who haven't seen one in sixty days or so. The French seemed to enjoy it more than we did. When the,ero took the leading lady to his heart it almost created a riot. They are the most sentimental people I ever saw. Nothing pleases them more than to see a soldier come home from the front to visit his family. The whole town turns out to see 'em meet and then turns out again to see them part; and from what I can gather they cheer and egg the principals on to do s much kissing in public as possible. They did just that way at the picture show.\n\nThere was a real American train in one of the pictures (which was a train robbery) and I'll tell you it sure looked good. My how I would like to ride in a real American Pullman with a nigger porter and everything. If these coaches over here are first class then a Pullman is AA1 and then some.\n\nIt will almost be like home to get with the regiment again not only to see all the boys but to get all our letters from home. I am sure that's where they are. It will be one grand day when they do get to us, I tell you. We are all steadily hoping every day to get a letter so keep on writing. I am still living in fine style at the Chateau with no prospects of going up front. I wish I knew something to write but I don't. If I tell you more than I have about the country the censor'd cut it out, so I can only say as always I love you.\n\nHarry\nHarry S Truman 1st Lt 129 F.A. American EF France via N.Y.,"

It evidently went all over the world and finally found me at this artillery school. It was your letter thanking me for the Easter violets. I am glad you got them and that they were all right. I was on the sea sure enough when you got them. I am sure you must have heard from me before this. You hoped in that letter that you would get my cable. I could not cable but I'd made other arrangements at New York which,should have reached you a few days after we landed. I have also written every time I've had a minute to get a letter in.\n\nYou've no idea how much pleasure a letter from you can give. I am the envy of every officer in the school who didn't get a letter and there were only about four. We can't understand what has become of our letters. I suppose they must have gone wherever the division is. I hope to get an armful whenever they arrive. Oh won't it be a grand day when they all arrive. If one can put me into the seventh heaven what do you suppose seven or eight or a dozen will do. I'll probably be so happy I'll simply float away.\n\nWouldn't it be one grand,glorious feeling to get into Lizzie and take a ride over the country to Atherton and have a picnic as we did on several holidays I can remember.\n\nI am glad you got to see Oh! Boy. I tried to see it in New York and couldn't get in.\n\nWe had a regular field meet today in the Chateau Park. Major Gates and Major Rutlege tied themselves together and ran in the three legged race. For a wonder they didn't fall down. They had relay races and two baseball games. The student officers ran a relay race against the teacher officers and beat 'em to death. They had it all primed against us too to run in a couple of ex college runners and we went them one better and ran in three. I was an interested spectator in all their games.\n\nWe hope to be with our organizations in about ten days, and you've no idea how glad we'll be. Please keep up that three a week because it will make life worth living for another sixty days when they come. I appreciate Mrs. MacDonald's inquiring about me. I told Geo Arrowsmith his girl is wearing a pretty ring and he blushed like a school girl.

    "content": ",France, May 26, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\nAnother week gone and still no letters. I know they are somewhere in France though and that I'll get 'em some day. Captain Babcock who is going to school here is a very happy man today; he got about thirty letters yesterday. They were the first he'd received since coming over.\n\nWe have been working as hard or harder than usual this week. I've studied more and worked harder the last three weeks than I ever did before in my life. It's just like a university only more so; right out of one class into another and then examinations and thunder if you don't pass.,We had a maneuver yesterday and General Pershing himself was there. I was in command of a battalion of artillery and he didn't even come around to see if I could fire that many guns. I'm very happy that he didn't because we had more figures and things than would fill an old Ray's arithmetic. My part was mostly play like except the figures. I was supposed to have three batteries, while we were represented by three second lieutenants. Had a second lieut. for adjutant and a major for regimental commander. We had a good time and walked about six miles besides. There were Major Generals Brigadiers Colonels Majors and more limousines than a Tammany funeral.,It was a very great pleasure to see a Major General click his heels together and nearly break his arm coming to a salute when the General came along. You don't often get to see Major Generals do that. We are going to have a critique on the problem today and I suppose we'll get a lot of useful and useless information. I'll sure be glad when I get back to the battery and don't have to figure x-y=pdg or something else equally as enlightening. Everyone in the room as usual on Sunday is writing home and everyone as usual is stuck for something to say except for Geo Arrowsmith he can write volumes over a dead sparrow but the rest of us can't. We've told,all we know about the scenery the people the place and about all we can say is that I love you and wish I had a letter and wish I could see you and go to church tonight.\nPlease keep writing because I'll get them some day and I'll write just as often as artillery will let me.\n                                                                                                                           Yours always\n                                                                                                                              Harry\nHarry S.

    "content": ",Somewhere in France May 19, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI am still somewhere in France going to school like a darned kid, and I guess I'll keep on going for some weeks to come. No letters yet since the first week I was here, but I know there are a bushel of them somewhere. They send them just as the mailman feels when they come. If he's facing the south bag when he gets our mail that's where it goes, and if he's facing the north bag, why it goes north, etc. ad lib. I guess we'll get 'em sometime. I went off on a truck,ride this morning over to the adjoining town. It wasn't any different from the other French towns I've seen, but the ride was beautiful. The French know how to build roads and also how to keep them up. They are just like a billiard table and every twenty meters there are trees on each side. I have raved over the scenery in every letter I've written and it is worth raving about, but it was particularly beautiful this morning because the sun was shining. It has shone for two days to-,gether - a really unusual occurrence. I didn't take my raincoat because it was so pretty and bright, and as was to be expected it rained to beat thunder. We were lucky though and got home between showers. It's sure pouring down now. If you'll read the letters that came out in Collier's about a month ago, you will get a very good and vivid description of France as we see it.\n\nWe have been working harder than ever. I had an examination Saturday that would make the president of Yale University bald-headed scratching his head trying to think of answers. I think we'll all be nuttier than an Arkansas squirrel if we study this hard much longer. I am now an orienting officer (whatever that may be). From what I can gather in a casual survey of the situation, I am supposed to go out on the earth somewhere and find out where I am and then tell everybody else. It's a nice job as far as I can discover if I can get a little surveying, geometry, astronomy, and a few other things into my noodle inside the next three or four weeks. If it doesn't bust, I guess,I can do it.\n\nWe have so much to do all week that Sunday is the only day we can write letters home. I suppose you only get them about every three weeks anyway. I would have given my anticipated service stripe for a chance to see you today. We all hope to wind things up at this school with great honor or all go home efficiencied one. I hope it will be the first anyway much as I'd like to see you and home.\n\nThe rest of the gang are all writing letters or trying to. They write a few sentences and then,sing a few song of home and then write some more.\n\nI played the piano at the officers YMCA at the town I visited today. It was the best piano I've seen since leaving USA. It was a dandy, evidently belonging to some rich Frenchman who had given his house for YMCA purposes. There were whole volumes of music by Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann, Mendelshon, Litz (can't spell 'em) and everyone else you ever heard of. It was sure rest after the week's work.\n\nI am hoping to get some letters this week sure, so keep,on writing. Remember that I'm thinking of you all the time anyway if I don't write every day. Every fellow in this room is engaged to some fine girl back in the States and the French girls haven't a chance. None of us have ever seen any worth raving over yet. I guess all the pretty ones are in Paris anyway. I'd like to go see but I guess I won't anyway soon.\n\nYours always, \nHarry\n\nHarry S Truman \n1st Lt. 129 F.A. \nAmerican E.F.,Harry S Truman \n1st Lt 129th F.A. \nAmerican E.F. \n                                                                                 Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n[stamped:\"A.E.F.

They won't let us cable for things like informing our people we landed safely because the wires are so crowded they can't send them.  I guess you've got my cable I left in New York by this time anyway.  My cussed pen went dry right up there and I had to get up and fill it.  I am in a French hotel room about as big as your grandmother's room and the front hall combined and the floor's as cold as the top of a lake when it's frozen and the grip with the ink had to be as far from the bed as it could be.  The electric switch turns off the light in the center of the room, and another turns lights on over the head of the bed.  You can't light both at once—when one's on the other goes off automatically and as the bed is the warmest I am writing this in bed.  We go to work tomorrow and I have been seeing this town, which is quite wonderful to me.  It isn't Paris, but if Paris is as much livelier as it is bigger, Paris is some town.  Wine and beer are sold here and most of the 35th Division have been in Oklahoma so long that they are trying to drink all there is here.  They can't as the supply seems to be inexhaustible.  Prices are marked strictly on the American plan in French money and they skin us alive.  Our dinners cost as 10 francs apiece, about $1.80, so you see things are not so cheap.  One fellow bought him a Sam Brown belt for 40 franks (I don't know why I spelled that with a k) and gave the man a ten-dollar bill.  He got 60 francs in change and the belt so he made a belt and 3 francs by the deal and didn't know it until someone told him that ten dollars was 57 francs.  \n\nThis is a beautiful place.  I wish I could tell you where it is.  (Call Boxley up.)  The room I have at the Hotel des Voyageurs is furnished in mahogany with double lace curtains at its windows.  It has a picture of Henry IV and his children on one side and Henry VIII of England at some state function on the other.  There is a fire place (no fire) with a white marble mantelpiece, which has a Dutch clock under a glass case.  (The clock doesn't run, probably on account of its age.)  It is a beautiful gold affair with a couple of seventeenth-century pikemen on top of it.  It is flanked by two exquisitely beautiful lamps and there is a large mirror over the whole thing about four feet square.    The chairs are upholstered in red plush.  It looks more like some count's bedroom than a hotel room.  \n\nI went to a picture show and saw Pearl White in one of the sections of a spasm that has been running a year or so over in U.S.A.  The name and explanations were in French and I've forgotten its name but it was good old mellerdramer and I had not seen this episode.  There was a comedy and another complete film that was good and a dancer named Miss Theer.  We got tired and left before the show was over or I guess we could have been there yet.  It began at two-thirty and we left at five-thirty, all for 1 franc 45 centimes—about 35 cents.  \n\nWe had a most pleasant voyage and I found a well-formed rumor that we were sunk when we got to port.  The navy has the army beaten forty ways for wild stories.  \n\nI've got to quit because it's 10:00 P.M. and lights go out at nine o'clock and I'm liable to get arrested.  \n\nWrite me as below.                                                                     \n\nYours always,\nHarry S.

There is a fire place (no fire) with a white marble mantelpiece, which has a Dutch clock under a glass case.  (The clock doesn't run, probably on account of its age.)  It is a beautiful gold affair with a couple of seventeenth-century pikemen on top of it.  It is flanked by two exquisitely beautiful lamps and there is a large mirror over the whole thing about four feet square.    The chairs are upholstered in red plush.  It looks more like some count's bedroom than a hotel room.  \n\nI went to a picture show and saw Pearl White in one,[printed at the top center, in red] crossed cannons; One Hundred Twenty-Ninth; Field Artillery [/printed]\n\nof the sections of a spasm that has been running a year or so over in U.S.A.  The name and explanations were in French and I've forgotten its name but it was good old mellerdramer and I had not seen this episode.  There was a comedy and another complete film that was good and a dancer named Miss Theer.  We got tired and left before the show was over or I guess we could have been there yet.  It began at two-thirty and we left at five-thirty, all for 1 franc 45 centimes—about 35 cents.,[printed at the top center, in red] crossed cannons; One Hundred Twenty-Ninth; Field Artillery [/printed] \n\nWe had a most pleasant voyage and I found a well-formed rumor that we were sunk when we got to port.  The navy has the army beaten forty ways for wild stories.  \n\nI've got to quit because it's 10:00 P.M. and lights go out at nine o'clock and I'm liable to get arrested.  \n\nWrite me as below.                                                                     \n\nYours always,\nHarry S.

    "content": ",France, May 12, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI am hoping for another letter today. Got one last Sunday and it put some much pep into me that I passed this week's exams with flying colors. Even worked out my probabilities right and that's some job. I'm getting a college education in Geometry Trig and Astronomy. I can be County Surveyor when I get back.\n\nEveryone in the room is writing either to his girl or his mother. I am going to write mamma too because Gen Pershing has ordered everyone to although I don't need any order. There is absolutely nothing to tell you. I am in the same fix that Jack Hatfield's nigger,was I told you about on the boat. If you didn't get that letter may be I'd better tell you again. This coon told Jack he wanted to write to Liza. Jack told him all right and started the letter for him as Dear Liza. The coon then said, \"I loves you.\" All right Jack told him he had that, \"I loves you.\" Jack put that down for him. The coon scratched his head a while and then said, \"Your lovin' man, Henry.\"\n\nI've told you about the Chateau its part its moat its marble stairs & carved wood work, its ice cold baths and its little picture book village. I could tell you lots and lots of events but the devilish censor would only tear it up and you wouldn't get any letter.,I don't know if I told you about the O'Grady exercises they give us every day but they are interesting -  to look at and read about. They make us run and walk and play leap frog and carry men on our backs and run relay races while we carry them. Then they line us up and give us exercises by separate command in which \"O'Grady says\" has to precede each command. If a man moves at a command that isn't preceded by \"O'Grady says\" he had to run a hundred yards and back. Then they make a big ring and make everyone face in and one man runs around and hands out a couple of shelalas and the man on the right of the one who gets the whip has to run around the ring. If the one,with the whip can catch him he whales the mischief out of him. Its sure funny to see a little short man like Major Gates or Slagle try to get away from some long legged guy. The little one usually gets followed all the way around much to the delight of the rest. I ran so fast the other day that I got a Charlie horse and was not able to run for two days. I guess it's good to take out the cobwebs that the studies put into our brains. I am dizzy most of the time but I hope to come out on top and then real business will begin. I heard that Bill Bostain was not far from here at an infantry school but that he had gone up to General Hdquts so he may be on the front now,for experience. They say it's great experience and that you learn more in a week than you knew all your life before. I expect it's so. Hope to find out some day but I'm far from it now. Be sure and keep writing because it's sure lonesome over here when there's an hour to spare from work. I'll write as often as they'll let me even if I can only say I love you. I love you.\n\nYours always\nHarry\n\nHarry S. Truman \n1st Lt. 129 FA \nAmerican E. F. France,"

Very touching when Clara Kimball does it and caused the French audience to clap very loudly when he took her in his arms in the last act.  All the explanations were in French, so I just guessed the thing out.  They put on a real American picture the other night, Douglas Fairbanks, and everything was in good United States language.

    "content": ",May 5, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI wrote you this morning and got another letter this afternoon dated April 6 in which you said you had my last letters from New York. I sent you an Easter package from New York too. I hope you got it.\n\nI am glad you got into communication with George Arrowsmith's fiancÃ©e. We are not supposed to talk much about our comrades but since you know if George is in the same room with me along with three other first Lieuts of 129th F.A. We are a very congenial bunch and everyone is sure happy today because Jack got a letter from his lady love in St. Louis. Walter got one,from his in Kansas City. Pat got one from his in Red Lodge, Montana, and George and I got one from Independence. I have been slighted today because each of the others got two. I think my one though was worth more than all the rest put together. You've no idea how high I jumped when I got it. That's getting mail mighty quickly from 6 of April to 5 of May.\n\nI told you this morning that I dreamed I was at a show with you and your letter came wishing I was at one with you instead of your going to a W.W. club meeting. I am writing every time I get a chance but it looks as if school days are so buy I can't do much writing during the week but I hope to make it up on Sunday and,any off days we get. I hope you have better luck calling mamma up next time. I had a letter from her Friday along with your three dated Mar 26, 27, 28 and it nearly made me homesick. She doesn't write very often but she sure does write well when she does. We work so hard during the week we don't have time to think of anything but work. Sundays are sure dull though if we don't get letters to read. Be sure and write and keep writing and I'll do the same. We sure appreciate letters and more letters from home.\n\nFrance is France and a grand place for Frenchmen. I don't blame them for fighting for it and I'm for helping them but give me America Missouri and Jackson County for mine with the finest girl in the world of the county seat. French girls are pretty and chic but they cannot hold a candle to American girls. Every man in this room agrees with me too.\n\nIt's raining today for a change after starting out with a grand sunrise and a fine morning. We've seen the sun about four days since we've been in France. The weather doesn't bother us much but I'll bet a Frenchman would suffocate if he got into a heated room. They're never warm from September till June. They thrive on it though. Be sure and write to me much and often for I can always put in another week happily if I get at least one letter. The more the better. I'm sure crazy to see you.\n\nYours always, \n                        Harry\n129 FA USA \nA.E.F.

    "content": ",May 5, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThis is the end of the most strenuous week I ever spent in my life. Day before yesterday was a banner day too for the week because I got three letters from you dated Mar 26, 27, 28 also got two from home, one from Mary Colgan, one from Myra and one from Ethel. I claim that was a day. Probably won't get any more for another six weeks. They were all sent on from the port of embarkation and in all probability came over on the boat with us and have been touring France right along with us all the time. I can't understand why you didn't hear from me at Camp Merritt because I wrote nearly every day. The last letter I sent from the pier by a boy who was passing and he probably didn't mail it.\n\nI had a grand dream night before last (the night after your letters came).,Thought I was in K.C. at a show of some kind with you. I sure did hate it when the confounded church bell next door woke me at 5:30 A.M. and I found I was 4000 miles from where I wished I was. When I come home I'll be a surveyor, a mathmatitian [sic], a mechanical draftsman, a horse doctor, a crack shot and a tough citizen if they keep me here long. We have periods of lectures and exams and everything just like West Point.\n\nThe day begins at 7 A.M. and ends at 9:30 P.M. with an hour and a half of study. There is hardly time to get from one class to another and they sure give us thunder if we are late. Had a stem winding examination on Friday. I don't know if I passed or not but hope I did.\n\nWe have had several sunny days this week and I am beginning to think that there is a really sunny France. This place is an ideal one,to study, nothing to bother but clocks and church bells and mocking birds. I suppose we'll get used to them. We live in a chateau that would make some American millionaire green with envy to own if he could get it. We have our private park all enclosed with a high stone wall where we have O'Grady exercise every day from 11:30 to 12. These exercises almost kill some of us old men. The muscles of one of my arms and one of my legs are so sore I can hardly move them. They make us run races, have tugs of war, carry a man on our backs and run races and do all sorts of worthy things. We'll be able to whip a bunch of wild cats when we are through.\n\nIt would surprise you to see what a grand glorious feeling it puts into a man over here to get a letter. Some of our dignified Majors and Captains simply go wild when they get one. Every one who hasn't a wife has a girl back home and it sure does put the pep into a man when those l,pep into a man when those letters come. I certainly appreciate your standing in the P.O. to get a letter off to me and when I come home I'll show you how much I appreciate it. Nellie Port must be a card. I am going to try to send you a cable today I understand we can send them from a nearby town if I can get permission to go over there. They wouldn't let me send one when I landed.\nRemember that I think of you always and when this war for Democracy is over and the great American army marches down the streets of Washington I am hoping you I will be there to see the performance together. Every American believes that when we are ready the Germans will be whipped in short order.\n\nPlease write as often as you can because you've no idea how good yard letters make me feel and how much better I can work.\n\nYours always, \n            Harry.\n129 FA  \nVia N.Y.

I tried every day for three days after getting off the boat to get one off but was refused every day. I left a letter in New York that was to be mailed as soon as the boat arrived and I suppose you have it by this time.\n\nI have been touring France quite extensively at the expense of the American Government and haven't gone to work yet. The country is very pretty and I don't blame the French for wanting to keep it. I wouldn't trade any of U.S. for an equal part of France but if I had to give up being a Missourian I'd be a citizen of France by second choice. Every inch of the country that is at equal to growing anything is in cultivation. Their boundary lines run every which direction, and I don't see how they ever describe a piece of property when they want to transfer it. The cities seem to be just as bad. The fields make an irregular patchwork of the landscape when seen from a distance and if I were a painter I'd surely want to go to work on the scenery right away. It's a shame that our business is to tear up all the pretty places and villages we can instead of putting something more to them. They tell me that the part of France that Germany,has mussed up was just as pretty and well taken care of as what I've seen and that now it is a desert. They (the French) seem to think that we are going to help them very materially to get it back .\nWe are well fed, well housed and treated too well. I am getting fat and lazy from lack of work and I'm afraid my hair is coming out. Isn't that a calamity? I never felt better or knew less in my life. I can't write you a real letter because about the only thing I can say and be within the law is old man Cicero's Sivales bene est saleo and I may be court-martialed for saying that if some hick censor doesn't happen to know what it means.\n\nI am sure crazy to hear from you and from home. The last letter I had was March 28. That's the longest I've been without word from you since I can remember. I am hoping to get about a bushel of letters if our mail ever catches up. Have been riding around so much and as we can only mail letters at certain places that I haven't written for several days. If I'm here tomorrow will write again.

    "content": ",April 28, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThe fourth Sunday after Easter and I am just now ready to go to a real artillery school. Have had a splendid tour of the Atlantic Ocean and France. Have seen France as no civilian tour could possibly see it and now have a room with four of the most congenial first lieutenants in the regiment at an old chateau with a beautiful garden, a moat, a fine park, and a church with a chime clock and the most beautifully toned bell I ever heard. The hardships of this war are sure easy to bear so far.\n\nMajor G. and I took a walk yesterday afternoon and turned off on a road that said \"Chemin Particulier.\" Neither of us knew what that was. Evidently it means private road, for we ran into another chateau. There was a man at the gate who invited us in and showed us a park with,a pretty little stream running through it. There was a swan on it and some green and white ducks. The gardens were things of beauty. There was an old mill in the park where they made flour (before the war), their own ice plant, electric dynamo, and every other convenience. There were six kinds of horse vehicles (no horses, gone to war), three autos in a garage that looked like pictures of Swiss homes you've seen. The whole thing was surrounded by a six-foot wall. Take it all together, the major and I had a very pleasant walk. It belongs to a French colonel .\n\nHave not gotten any letters yet although I'm hoping to get some in the next thirty days or so. Gee what I would give for one teeney weeny letter from you. I've read and reread those I got at the port of embarkation until they are nearly worn out. The rest of the gang are in the same fix. Everyone of 'em is writing his sister or his cousin or his aunt,right now. I think we'd give all our next month's pay and a lien on the next for a letter from home.\n\nWe couldn't be more comfortably situated anywhere in the world. If we don't learn our lessons it won't be because our surroundings aren't right. If I could only tell you all the things we've seen and done since arriving. We've got a hard boiled Col in charge here but he's a fine man and I think will put the fear of God into some of us. Some of these birds seem to think they are on a grand picnic and it seems like we are but we've got to work like thunder from this out.\n\nWe got here Saturday night and I couldn't go to sleep right away because the church clock would strike eleven and then the clock on the Hotel de Ville would strike eleven five minutes later and then five minutes (It takes longer to address than to write),later some clock that I haven't been able to locate yet would strike eleven. By that time the church clock had started on eleven fifteen and it was one continual round of pleasure all night long. They've gotten them all together today but I don't know how long they'll stay that way.\n\nWent to church this morning. Catholic in French. Couldn't understand a word but I reckon it was all right because they took up a collection and Major G told me that the drift of the Priest's little French talk was that the ration should be adhered to and that the girls shouldn't flirt with the gay Americans.

It sure makes a fellow feel like he is someone to have the nicest girl in the world telegraphing to see if he is on his pins or not. I have been the busiest mortal on the reservation since returning. They closed the canteen on the 10th and forced us to take an invoice right away and then opened up again. I had an awful time proving up because my Jew was in Kansas City. In addition to that I have had,the Battery office to straighten out and the Battery mess to run. I have also had to attend drills morning and afternoon and go to school at night. General Berry told us yesterday that we would have to learn the drill regulations by heart and do several other impossible stunts. If it my opinion that an elimination process is taking place preparatory to our going aboard. I mentioned in my wire that I would probably write you from an eastern port soon. You can put your own construction on it because we can't write about some arrangements that are taking place here. I am very lucky I think. You probably won't think so. Besides I may get a physical and get sent home. I'd very nearly croak if I do as badly as I would like to be home. You certainly have a letter from me by this time. I think the mail service is disabled on account of the storms. We had the most terrific,blizzard I ever saw. Couldn't see your hand before you. The snow blew just like sand does in summer.\n\nI am going to the better about writing from this out and when I can't write I'll wire you a night letter. I am looking for a letter today. I haven't written mamma and Mary since I came down.

As I told you I am rather stuck up over the fact that you wired although I'm mighty sorry to have caused you worry.\n\nThe wristlets came today and are as fine as can be. They are the right color, they fit exactly and are heavier than Mr. Lee's. I appreciate the inside address on the box but I fear it will be some time before I become general. We are working almost night and,day to perfect our regiment. The Col. says that in order to win we've got to have a better army than the best army in the world. The men all seem to be working to that end. We've got to win at whatever cost. They are weeding out incompetent officers and men I may get sent home yet you never can tell.\n\nI am very much pleased that Bundschu should say so many good things about me. He has always been might nice to me down here and I have tried to treat him the same way. He is a very competent,supply officer. Maj. Miles is not a Lt. Col. I suppose someone heard that he is second in command in the regiment and just naturally thought he was Lt. Col. and Maj. Miles being the senior major is second in command naturally. He is a fine officer. \n\nI have been so busy I don't have time to get homesick but I wish I could see you. You can't imagine how badly I wish it. But it can't be done now. When the war's over we'll make up for time lost. Remember it has to be won and someone has to do it. I am sure you wouldn't have me be a slacker much as you'd like me to be at home. I know that's how mamma feels although she sure hates to see me go. If I get a kick out for incompetence then I'll know I've tried anyway and I can stay at home with a clear conscience. (I'd rather be shot though). Yesterday was a grand day - you letter came and it also was one to make me feel all stuck up. Send one as often as you can.

He didn't have the required allotment of clothes and we had to run around to the Q.M. and the Ordnance Depots and buy and carry all,morning. I went along with him because he didn't know which red string to unwind to get quick action. I had already been around and could show him. After we'd done all that torn up our tents, packed our grips, etc., the order came that we'd not go for thirty days. I think they are keeping us here to get an opportunity to give some of us an efficiency test and send us home.

    "content": ",[letterhead: Knights of Columbus / Overseas Service / on Active Service / with American Expeditionary Forces]\n\n[printed: A. P. O] Verdun, France\n[printed: Date] Nov 23 1918\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nSince the censorship was eased up somewhat today I am going to try and tell you from the beginning to end and tell you just what happened to me after I left Camp Coetquidan, which is the training camp whose picture I told you to look up in Saturday Evening Post of May 18, 1918.  If I remember correctly I told you this camp was situated north of a town made famous by an Edit of Louis XIV.  Well, that Edit I find was issued by Cardinal Richelieu.  Coetquidan is half way between Nantes & Rennes [sic], the ancient capital of Britony.  (This letter is going to be an awful bore I know and I'd advise you to discard it right now, but I have a suspicion that I have somewhat busted the censorship rules in past,letters and I want to ease my conscience by telling you now a few things I should not have before). We were loaded on one of these toy French trains which are made up of seventeen flats thirty box cars, marked Cheveaux 8, Hommes 40, one first class passenger coach and two cabooses one in front and one behind.  The Cheveaux 8 Hommes 40 are for the men and horses of the battery, the flats for the guns and caissons, and the first class car for me and my lieutenants.  We loaded about 5 A.M. making a record, the best time ever made by a battery loading from that camp, pulled out at 8 A.M. and road half across, I mean all the way across France to a town in Alsace called Saulxures.  It took us about two days and a half and was very tiresome.  We stopped in Saulxures a couple of days and one night I got an order to be ready to go up to the front and make a reconnaisance for the purpose of going into position at 4 A.M. the next morning.  Every battery commander got the same order and there was great hubbub and excitement about going into position before the enemy for the first time.  It did,give me a real creepy feeling, one I shall never forget although I've gone into some real positions since them.  I have never felt about them exactly as I did that first one.  We rode about 15 kilometers in a truck through some of the prettiest and hilliest country I ever saw to a town called Kruth which was full of German sympathisers and French soldiers.  We got horses that had been sent up the night before and the real climb up the Vosges to our positions began.  It took us until noon to reach the headquarters of the French group commander and it was a steady climb all the way.  They Huns were shelling a cross road not far from those headquarters and I got to see my first enemy shell light and it was not a very pleasant sensation.,The S.O.S. or Camp Doniphan seemed very pleasant and very far away.  I met Major Staton just before I came to that cross roads and he treated me like a long lost brother.  I was just as glad to see him too.  I got by without getting any shells on or near me and they assigned a French Lieutenant who understood not a word of English to go and show me my battery position which was to be an entirely new one in Foret de Herenburg some seven kilos further yet.  It was noon by this time and Major Gates and I ate dinner with the French commandant.  They served it in usual French style a course at a time and a clean plate for every course.  French officers always eat that way.  It takes them so long to serve a meal that I'm always hungrier when I get done than I ever was before.  We finally got done and the French Lt. and myself and my instrument and telephone sergeants started around to my position.  We had to go around a mountain to get to it and also cross a ridge in plain view of the Boche.  The French man made us go over the ridge,a hundred meters apart so the Hun would not suspect that we were going to put a battery in that place.  It was never necessary afterwards because I don't ever remember a clear day after that one.  The ridge and my battery position were in a cloud all the rest of our stay there which was about ten days.  Well we finally got the position picked out and proceeded to locate the positions for the guns, pick out a kitchen site and a place to keep my saddle horses.  The position is 1200 meters above sea level and some six or eight hundred above the valley where Kruth is.  It was on a bare knot about two kilometers long one end of which is called Schniepfenreith and the other Foret de Herrenburg because the woods,comes up to the edge of it at that end.  I chose a place in the edge of the woods for the battery and a place further down in the woods for the kitchen.  There is a rock road running down the side of the hill and it was about 200 meters straight up from this road to my kitchen.  All the supplies, water etc. had to be carried up by hand as well as all the material for construction.  The battery was brought in over the ridge at night but that road could not be used any more because the positions would have been given away to the Boche air photos.  Myself and my sergeants camped in the woods a couple of days getting things ready and then I brought the battery up.  I found that there was a road about half as long as the one I first came up running directly to my position from Kruth.  The battery you understand had been brought to Kruth by one of my Lts. during the two days I was getting the position ready.  One of the men dropped a can of lard when they were bringing up the kitchen supplies from the lower road and it rolled all the way,to the valley below scattering lard on every tree it hit and finally landing a battered piece of tin at the bottom.  One of the kitchen police went down the next day and gathered in the lard getting a chunk from a tree and a chunk from a bush and maybe some on the ground.  Anyway the cooks rendered out the sticks and saved a half a can of lard.  It was surely some steep hill and the trees were all full of wire entanglements.  If a man had started to roll down he'd have been in shreds when he got to the bottom.  Well I worked on that position and followed all the rules in all the books to the letter and never did fire a shot from it.  I got ordered one day to go pick out a position some two kilometers close to the Dutch lines and get ready to fire a gas barrage at him.  I was supposed,to have 24 hours to get ready but only had about six.  My horses were seven kilos away and no phone to them.  You should have seen the hurrying and skurrying I did to get into position and get adjusted and ready to fire.  I got ready and went up to the O[bservation].P[ost]. and began my adjustment.  That was my first shot at Heine and it was an event.  The boys heard some way that I was going to shoot at a brewery and it was with great regret that they pulled the trigger.  It was a mistake because I didn't shoot at the brewery although I could have.  They are saving the case of that first cartridge and I hope to see it engraved with the date, place and event and installed with other important things in D. Bty's archives in Kansas City some day.  You know the rest of that eventful day.  I shot my gas barrage at 8 P.M.  The first sergeant failed to get the horses up in time and the Hun gave me a good shelling.  The sgt. ran away and I had one high old time getting out of that place.  I finally did with two guns and went back to my former position arriving at 4 A.M. where the cooks had the best,hot meal I've tasted since I arrived in France with one exception.  The boys called that engagement The Battle of Who Run, because some of them ran when the first sgt. did and some of them didn't.  I made some corporals and first class privates out of those who stayed with me and busted the sgt.  Bill O'Hare whose letter you saw in the paper was one of 'em.  \n\nWe didn't stay long at the old position but got ordered to move everything down to Kruth which is where I wrote you about the engagement.  We stayed about two days in Kruth and then got ordered to fill all our caissons and pull out.  We did.  And marched every night until the 12th of Sept (Pulled out the 31st).  We didn't start marching though until we'd been loaded on a train at a,place called Remiremont.  I went to bed and supposed we'd ride all night but about 3:30 a Lt. Col. woke me up and told me that in 18 minutes I would be unloaded at Bayon and that Bayon was under constant aeroplane bombardment and I must have my battery under cover before daylight.  Well I was scared green.  I was in command of the train and there was absolutely no one to pass the buck to.  I simply had to unload that battery and find a place for it before day light.  The Lt. Col. gave me a map and told me of a possible location if someone else hadn't beaten me to it.  He also told me and marked out for me a line of march I was to pursue on the next two nights.  Well I got all unloaded and under cover without a mishap.  There were two dead horses on the platform with bullet holes in thier [sic] backs and I told my outfit that it was evidently the work of machine guns from aeroplanes and they'd better speed up the unloading.  Well they did all right and I found that the Lt. Col (by the way he was Champ Clark's son) had,given me a good steer.  There was no one else in the woods he had suggested that I go into.  I spent a very pleasant day snoozing and watching the men bath in the Moselle River.  We were right on the bank of the river.  I got up about noon and went up to the depot to watch Col. Elliott and the Supply Company detrain.  I told him all the harrowing tales I could think of regarding the daylight attacks of Hun planes, showed him the two dead horses and invited him to draw his own conclusions as to how they'd met their fate and just what he could expect if a Hun plane came.  (I found after wards that those horses were shot by a vet because they couldn't walk).  Col. E. was duly impressed and as I had already preempted most of the woods he was about wild trying to find,a place to put himself and the supply Co.  He finally had me to make room for him along side of my battery and he came piling in in broad daylight.  That was usually about what happened to all our well thought out preparations.  They were usually nullified by old mother necessity and we did as we'd do in any other enterprise, just the best we could.\n\nThey changed my orders about four times that day as to where I was to go but finally decided it would be the first place I'd started for and my era of night marches began.  I passed a whole regiment of infantry strung out for four or five miles and would have passed another regiment of 'em but their brigade adjutant got hold of me about them and gave me a terrible wigging.  He looked like a bishop and if I ever meet him in civil life I shall certainly knock his block off.  He made me wait until that whole regiment I'd passed went by me.  I stood at that crossroad from 9 o'clock until 3 A.M. and then had to poke along behind that outfit until broad daylight.  We could hear Hun planes and saw them bomb Nancy and Luneville,over in the distance and expected any minute to get a good machine gunning.  But we didn't and finally arrived at a patch of woods and put up for the day.  With one exception that was the worst night I ever spent in France.  If that onery adjutant hadn't stopped me I'd have reached the town I was headed for by 2 o'clock and would not have had to make two nights of it.  The next night we went into a little old dirty place called Coyvillier.  We spent about five days there and then began marching again every night until we reached St. Mihiel where we were held in reserve.  I had a disagreeable experience getting out of that little old town all caused by C Battery.  It was up hill nearly straight up every direction out of the place and I pulled all my guns,up out of town in daylight but Marks tried to move all his battery out at once and naturally got stuck.  That split me in two leaving my guns up the hill and my combat train kitchen etc. behind C.  We were both supposed to move out at 8 P.M. but it was 9:30 before Marks got up the hill and 10:30 when I got my battery all together.  The road was so narrow I couldn't pull around him and I had to wait.  As usual it began to rain and I got left clear at the tail of the whole brigade but I was lucky anyway because I got a better place to stay that day than any of the others had.  I wrote you several letters from Coyvillier.  The next night we went through Nancy and heard the first continuous roar of artillery preparation.  I have heard it several times since but it's never sounded so big or so real as it did that night.  It was dark as Egypt and raining as usual and I had to ride behind the last carriage of the battery in front of me in order to see it.  That morning we arrived at the Foret de Haye and were in reserve for the San Miheil drive.  It was such a walk away that,they didn't need us but we were there and ready just the same.  We kept our horses harnessed night and day for two days and spent a very pleasant time watching Hun prisoners go by.\n\nThen one bright moonlight night we started night marching again.  We did 22 nights of it in September.  We marched for several nights and then went into a wood called the Argonne.  One of my Lts went up to look over my position and I stripped the battery for action.  I knew I was in for it this time because I only took the firing battery and just enough men to run the guns and they for the first time were allowed to ride.  I got stuck getting out of the woods.  One caisson got pig headed and I couldn't budge the cussed thing with either prayers or cuss words.  I tried both.  Finally hooked all the men onto,it with ropes and got it out and then and there began the wildest ride I ever hope to have.  It seemed as though every truck and battery in France was trying to get to the same front by the same road that I was going.  I had twelve carriages in my column four guns, six caissons, and two fourgun wagons one of them full of instruments and one full of grub. I don't know which I'd rather have lost.  I believe I could have gotten along better without the grub.  Well, I finally got my battery out on the main highway and headed for the front.  The real front this time west of Verdun and just alongside the Argonne Forest.  Those devilish trucks kept trying to cut me in two.  It was necessary to keep the battery moving at a trot and a gallop nearly all the way and I had to ride the line to see that they stayed closed up.  Every time I'd get a chance I'd cut in ahead of a row of trucks and sew 'em up until I got the whole battery by and every time a truck would get a chance he'd cut through the battery.  They didn't get very many chances because when we got the right of the road I,made it a point never to let 'em through.  In one little old village we passed we had to make a right angle turn around a curb and one of these bloomin' trucks drove up just as close as he could while one of my carriages was going by and then he had to stop because I started putting my horse squarely across in front of him and held the whole train of a division while the battery went passed.  Every one of my carriages either hit that truck a jolt or smashed into the curb but I got them by and went on down the road at a gallop to find that my second gun had a horse down in the road.  I don't know if I told you but it was raining as usual and the road was as slick as glass.  We finally got that horse up and it took me a solid hour of fast maneuvering to get that gun back,to its place in column again.  When we arrived at our position about 3 A.M. we found that it was in a little patch of woods just off the Forest de Hesse and south of Neuvilly about a kilometer on a mud road.  Well naturally after all that wild ride I had to get two caissons stuck in spite of the fact that at regular intervals Heine would drop a shell in that neighborhood just to let us know he was there.  By doubling up teams I finally got into position by daylight and then went up on the side of a hill in some woods and went to sleep.  Got up about 3 in the afternoon and picked out another place to put my cot which was very lucky for me because that night my first choice was unmercifully shelled and I'd be in small pieces now as would half my battery and my Lts if I'd stayed there.  We spent the next day, which was the 24th in digging trenches and preparing shelter for the men and figuring out ranges to different places to fire on.  When we did finally fire they gave us targets of course that we'd never figured for.  Every night Heine shelled,all the surrounding territory but missed me.  He shot up Pete Allen's bed just after Pete had gotten out of it and blew out an ammunition dump and killed a man for Salisbury. They were both within two hundred meters of me but a shell never came any closer than that all the time we were there but they lit on all sides of us and did shoot a hole through my kitchen stove pipe.  I promptly moved the kitchen on the urgent request of the cook.\n\nWell as I have written you already the eventful day was Sept. 26 and at 3:20 A.M. I began firing a barrage that lasted until 7:20.  My guns were so hot that they would boil wet gunny sacks we put on them to keep them cool and I was as deaf as a post from the noise.  It looked as though every,gun in France was turned loose and I guess that is what happened.  At 8:30 I hooked up and moved out at the head of the second battalion 129 FA because I got ready first. Got out in no man's land and the Colonel told me to go into action behind a hedge and walk out front and find if I could shoot up some machine guns that were playing hot with our infantry.  I went along with Major Gates but I found nothing to shoot at.  Got shot at myself and after looking around about an hour we decided to go back.  When I got back to the battery I found that the Hun had a bracket on me that is an over and a short and that I should get away from there as quickly as the Lord would let me.  The Colonel had ordered my Lt to limber up and had taken the rest of the regiment around another way.  I got hooked up before Heine started his fire for effect and started across no mans land crossways trying to get to a wood over behind Vauquois.  As usually under such circumstance I got stuck and had to hitch in the men.  We finally caught,the rest of the column and the Hun began to shell again.  They got a direct hit on one of Salisbury's wagons and completely wrecked it.  One of my men was sitting in a shell hole and a dud lit right between his legs.  If he hasn't a charmed life no one has.  The shelling finally got so bad we had to unlimber and wait for it to quit.  There was a little hollow we had to cross and when it finally got dark I hitched 12 horses on a piece and got across some way or other.  It was 3 A.M. when I had finally gotten all my carriages but two into that wood.  Those two are out in that no man's land yet I guess because I never did get them.  That was the worst night I ever spent.  Men went to sleep standing up and I had to make them keep on working because I,had to be in position to fire by 5 A.M. the 27th.  I got into position but the infantry advanced so fast I couldn't dig my trail holes deep enough to fire over them so I didn't get to fire that morning.  Out battalion got orders to move forward that day and we went up through Chepy and took up a position in front of Varennes.  I was the farthest front battery that afternoon and I got instructions to fire on Charpentry and go up and observe the fire.  I went up and by some unaccountable mistake got ahead of our front line infantry and didn't even have a pistol.  I got in a shell hole to observe fire and the infantry fell back and left me there.  I fell back also and established myself an O. P. at a tank headquarters and I've already told you what happened from then on.  I shot up a German battery in position one morning out and a German O.P. and I'm the only B.C. in the 129th who ever saw what he fired at and I think that is some distinction.  We stayed in until Oct 2 when we went back to a little dirty French town to rest and I'll say we all,needed it.  Every one of us was all most a nervous wreck and we'd lost weight until we looked like scare crows.  But we're all fit as fiddles now.  I weighed 174 today, which is about 20 pounds more than I ever did.\n\nWe stayed at Signeulles about a week and then they went us up on the real Verdun front.  My battery position for 3 weeks was right between Ft. Tavannes and Ft. de Souville and about 3 kilos from the famous Douamont the impregnable fort that saved Verdun and Paris.  I have already told you how we were shelled most every night and what a dreary desolate place it was.  I am most awful glad it's over and I hope I never have to fight in another one.   But it gives a fellow a kind of a satis-,-fied feeling when he knows he's done his best and that some 10,000 or 12,000 rounds were unloaded on Heine on the figures that he has prepared.  The best part of it is I still have all my men but two who were wounded when on special duty with the ammunition train and have both eyes both hands both feet and a fairly clear head.\n\nYou no doubt will be mighty tired time you get to this but I thought perhaps you'd like to know some of the things we did and saw.  I am still stopping in barracks not far from Verdun but expect to move soon whether to Germany or home I don't know but I hope it's home.\n\nRemember me to your mother and all the family and I hope you're not entirely bored to death.\n\nYours always\nHarry\n\nGene Sallers is all right and back with the battery.\n\nHarry S Truman\nCapt 129 F.A.\nAmerican E.

    "content": ",Dear Bess:\n\nI am keeping my promise although my hands are so cold I can hardly write.  It does no good to sit on them and you are so far away that old Dr. Miller's remedy can't be worked.  We are having a blizzard in real Western Plains style.  It began yesterday at noon, coming out of the northwest as suddenly as a thunderclap.  The weather was warm as springtime, the sun shining and everything fine, by night it was zero and snowing, sleeting,,doing everything else it shouldn't.  Our tent is usually as warm as a house but for some reason our stove refuses to draw this morning and we have a cold tent.  I am writing to Mamma this morning for the first time in two weeks.  I guess she thinks I'm already in France or at the bottom of the Atlantic.\n\nWe are sure a disappointed bunch.  Got our goods and chattels all packed, weighed, and marked and then turned right round and unpacked 'em.  The King of France had nothing,on us for we'd already arrived in Paris with a through ticket to Berlin, and now we've got to stay in this magnificent training camp and in all probability get benzined and sent home.  We'd all figured that we'd beaten the benzene board by a nose when we were ordered abroad.  They are most certainly giving us an intensive course of training.  We study drill regulations all week and take an examination on Saturday.  I have been closing out the canteen, doing Battery office work, drill, and going to school.  It is a strenuous life.  Don't hurt me any unless I get mad at someone or something and then there's a blowup.  I have also been teaching school for noncommissioned officers most every night until nine-thirty.  If I won't be a go-getter when I get out of this place, there's no one that will.\n\nThe present understanding is that our special detachment won't go now,until March.  So you may have the pleasure of seeing me permanently located in Jackson County before then.  I would most certainly like to be there for some very excellent reasons but I would hate to get sent home by a benzene board, although there'd be some satisfaction in knowing that I'd tried my best for the old stars and stripes.\n\nWe heard a lecture by an English colonel from the Western Front last night and it sure put the pep into us.  He made us all want to brace up and go to it with renewed energy.,He made us feel like we were fighting for you and mother earth and I am of the same belief.  I wouldn't be left out of the greatest history-making epoch the world has ever seen for all there is to live for because there'd be nothing to live for under German control.  When we come home a victorious army we can hold our heads up in the greatest old country on earth and make up for lost time by really living.  Don't you think that would be better than to miss out entirely?  I am crazy to get it over with,though because I wouldn't cause you a heartache for all there is in the world.\n\nYou'll never know how badly I hated to leave on the night I started back down here.  I can most certainly sympathize with an enlisted man who stays over his time.  A man sure ought to have some extra credits in the judgment book when he leaves the strongest ties in the world to do what is called duty, don't you think so?\n\nThis is a fun letter and it is a bad day.  Perhaps you'd better follow the advice of Agnes' suitor who always instructed her to put his epistles in the kitchen stove.  Anyway I love you just the same and more than ever and I'm working hard to finish the war quickly so we can make up for lost time.\n\nYours always,\nHarry\n\nSunday \nJan 27 '18,[cancellation stamp: Lawton Okla.

I am enclosing the forty cents for the very nice things you said to me.  Being written with red ink reminds me of a letter I censored for one of my Irishmen the other day.  He started out with blue ink and ran out so he said well here goes with a little blood and went on and finished his letter with red ink.  I suppose his girl thought he really used blood.  A letter from you written with charcoal, chalk, or clay would be fine enough to send me into the seventh heaven.  I don't care what they're written with long as I get them.\n\nI am very glad that Pike Sands holds no malice for my having busted him.  You know it is the hardest job a man ever undertook to be absolutely square and just to 194 men when you have good ones and bad ones (very few bad), smart ones and dull ones.  I love 'em all and if anybody wants a fight or a quarrel with me he can get it suddenly and all he wants if he says anything derogatory about my Battery or one of my men.  I wouldn't trade off the \"orneriest\" one I've got for any other whole Battery.  While I'm not a braggart I believe I can take my outfit and beat any other one in the A.E.F., shooting or doing any other kind of Battery work (every Battery commander in the regiment says the same thing).  I recommended one of my kids to go to West Point and he was one out of seven in the A.E.F. to go.  I was as proud of him as if I had done it myself.\n\nYou know I have succeeded in doing what it was my greatest ambition to do at the beginning of the war.  That is to take a Battery through as Battery commander and not lose a man.

I hope Bill Bostian has a good time and I wish I was in his place, except that I'd like to bring the Battery home now that it has gone through the war with me.

I hope Bill Bostian has a good time and I wish I was in his place, except that I'd like to bring the Battery home now that it has gone through the war with me.  I hope to ride a prancing steed down Grand Ave. at the head of D Bty, the fourth in the column when the last parade before the muster out is made.  I dreamed last night that I was trying to exchange a 100 franc note for real money in a Kansas City bank.  It was a disappointment when I found I wasn't there.\n\nI got a letter from Fred today and shall proceed to answer it.

There is a great big 155 Battery right behind me across the road that seems to want to get rid of all of its ammunition before the time is up.

For all their preparedness and swashbuckling talk they cannot stand adversity.  France was whipped for four years and never gave up and one good licking suffices for Germany.

    "content": ",[printed letterhead] Lee-Huckins Hotel Oklahoma City \n[Feb. 4, 1918]\n\nDear Bess:\nI am at Oklahoma City this time sure enough. Wired you this afternoon. I am like a parrot out of his cage. We have been hitting it up at such a rate down at camp that some of us almost have nervous prostration. The Scottish Rite are putting a class through, and General Wright issued a bulletin allowing four-day passes to Guthrie. It came out yesterday morning and was revoked at noon. I got mine before the cancellation intending to go to K.C. on it, but after they recalled the privilege I thought perhaps,I'd better not risk it. They are always hunting for some good excuse to rim a N.G. officer, and if they should suddenly take a fool notion to call me at Guthrie and I not be there, it would be all up but the signing. It is most surely a disappointment because I was planning on stepping into your front hall this evening at about seven-thirty and perhaps causing you heart failure for one minute anyway. I have been doing squads east and squads sideways, arms up and hand down until I can't open my mouth without telling,someone to straighten up or get in step. \"Hold your head up. Look at the back of the head of the man in front of you, if he isn't there look anyway. This ground's level, you won't fall down if you don't get your feet tangled. - - - -xx straighten up, step out like a man, put some snap into\" etc. etc. ad lib. Then after some hour or so of that I go count nickels and dimes up to four hundred dollars a day more or less. I guess I should be very proud of my Jewish ability. My thirst emporium is the only one in camp that's open. The rest are insolvent or can't,make a clear statement of their financial standing.\n\nI am going to forget drill-book exercise and all of it for three days anyway and occupy my mind on higher things. Perhaps that won't hurt me any because I have acquired an ability to swear like Sam Jones or Captain Kidd, and there may be a high reckoning on it sometime. I think not soon.\n\nWe have exams every Saturday. I have passed every time yet but the next one I'll probably blow up on. The hotel is full of soldiers and first lieutenants. Some going to Guthrie,and some going to the School of Fire and some, I fear, just playing hookey. I sure wish I could have happened in this evening, but I can't. I look for a letter every mail even if I don't send one.\nYours always, Harry,[printed envelope]\nReturn in five days to\nLEE-HUCKINS HOTEL\nOklahoma City, Okla.\n\n\n                                                                                      Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                      219 Delaware St.\n                                                                                      Independence\n                                                                                                                  Mo.,[printed envelope, back: Huckins Hotels\"]"

    "content": "Near Verdun\nCamp La Baholle\nDec. 14, 1918\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nIt is a dark, unwholesome French day and I am frankly homesick and very, very lonesome.  Christmas is approaching and I can't possibly see those I want to and I do so wish I could. I can't even send you a present that I'm sure you'll get, not even a cablegram. This devilish place is about seven kilometers from Verdun in a patch of woods. The sun hadn't shone in I don't know how many days nor does it look as if it ever intended to shine again. \n\nI guess it will though and I know it's shining in U.S.A. and at Nice. I am so glad you are a general. I shall always expect you to outrank me in our household and there is never any prospect of my ever being anything in the military line beyond a captain, although had the war continued, which God forbid, I should eventually have had another promotion. You tell Fred and May that I would have appreciated the major's leaves and the compliment very highly but I'd never have worn them. All promotions ceased in the A.E.F. on November 11, 1918, the greatest day in history.  Personally I'd rather be a Battery commander than a brigadier general. I am virtually the dictator of the actions of 194 men and if I succeed in making them work as one, keep them healthy morally and physically, make 'em write to the mammas and sweethearts, and bring 'em all home, I shall be as nearly pleased with myself as I ever expect to be—until the one great event of my life is pulled off, which I am fondly hoping will take place immediately on my having delivered that 194 men in U.S.A. You'll have to take a leading part in that event you know and then for one great future.  I've almost come to the conclusion that it's not intended for me ever to be very rich, nor very poor, and I am about convinced that that will be about the happiest state a man can be.  To have the finest girl in all the whole world (and to make the statement without fear of contradiction) to share my joys and troubles, mostly joys I'm hoping, to have just enough of this world's goods to make it pleasant to try for more, to own a Ford and tour the U.S.A. and France perhaps, although I've nearly promised old Miss Liberty that she'll have to turn around to see me again, and still have a nice little country home to be comfortable in—well that's really not a hard fortune to contemplate. Maybe have a little politics and some nice little dinner parties occasionally just for good measure. How does it sound to you?  Just its contemplation has almost cured me of the blues.  \n\nYou know when I was a kid, say about thirteen or fourteen, I was a tremendous reader of heavy literature like Homer, Abbott's Lives, Leviticus, Isaiah, and the memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte.  Then it was my ambition to make Napoleon look like a sucker and I thirsted for a West Point education so I could be one of the oppressors, as the kid said when asked why he wanted to go there.  You'd never guess why I had such a wild desire and you'll laugh when I tell you.  It was only so you could be the leading lady of the palace or empire or whatever it was I wanted to build.  You may not believe it but my notion as to who is the best girl in the world has never changed and my military ambition has ended by having arrived at the post of centurian.  That's a long way from Caesar, isn't it?  Now I want to be a farmer.  Can you beat it?  I'm hoping you'll like the rube just as well as you would have the Napoleon.  I'm sure the farmer will be the happier.  \n\nToday was our regular inspection day and I had to inspect Pete's battery and Salisbury inspected mine.  Pete looked over Salisbury's.  The Chief Gorilla gave me a very nice clean bill of health and of course I gave Pete one. You've no idea how scared some of these men get when a Captain stops in the inspecting process and asks him a question. Most of 'em would rather go over the top than talk on inspection day. I used to be that way myself but since I've got to the point where I do the questioning it seems real funny and I can't understand why I was ever afraid. I asked one man in line why he had no pistol and he swallowed about three times and finally succeeded in saying No, sir!  I found out that he was a replacement from the S.Q.S. and he'd been told that all the Captains of our Baty were hard boiled cookies and he'd better step straight. My Irish aren't afraid of me nor the Colonel either.  In fact they some times are very nearly disrespectful to him when he acts ludicrously they laugh at him. I rather admire 'em for it.\n\nYou are probably bored stiff by this time but I am writing you just as I feel today. I do wish I could see you Christmas Day.  I'll be thinking of you as I usually am anyway. I hope to have a better present for you next Christmas than the one I tried to send you this one.

I tried to get myself to write every day while I was there but the Guthrie citizens wouldn't let me. They kept us going from 8:00 A.M. until midnight.\n\nI stayed at the home of Governor Haskell's daughter, Mrs. Neblack. She is a grand woman and he is a fine man. She entertained us royally, taking us driving in her Hudson lim, introducing us to all the girls in town and doing her level best to see that we had an enjoyable time.,[letterhead; Lee-Huckins Hotel Oklahoma City]\n\nWe did. I looked every day for a letter or a wire but none came. I am hoping there'll be one when I get back to camp.\n\nThey put on all the Scottish Rite in as grand a form as I ever saw it from beginning to end. The Temple is fine and well arranged. They have a pipe organ and an organist that can play as well as Krieser I think.\n\nThey fed us three meals a day that would make Hoover blow up if he'd see them, and at the end they gave a dance, last night, and would let no one but soldiers dance.,[letterhead; Lee-Huckins Hotel Oklahoma City]\n\nThen's when I wished I was a dancer. There were girls from Norman, Tulsa, and all-around pretty girls, fat girls, tall ones, and short ones-and they were all doing their best to see that every soldier had every dance that went. I tried my luck at a one-step with my hostess and with Lieutenant Rainey's wife. They were both very kind to me and pretended that it didn't hurt when I stepped on their toes. Mrs. Neblack was all lit up in an evening gown as were most of the girls. The citizens had on soup and fish, and from every standpoint it was,[letterhead; Lee-Huckins Hotel Oklahoma City]\n\na grand occasion. I sat out most of the dances with some of the good old married sisters and the best-looking unmarried ones I could. We left at twelve o'clock last night and I don't know what Mr. Neblack's initials are and I suppose it's up to me to find out some way and write him a letter of appreciation.\n\nAnd now it's back to slavery of the worst sort, but I guess we can do it better now.\n\nThe boat that sank today I am informed is the one we'd have gone to England on if we'd,[letterhead; Lee-Huckins Hotel Oklahoma City]\n\ngot off on our special detail. I don't believe it though because we couldn't have made it to New York in time to get on it. Anyway the one I go on isn't going to sink. I do wish I could see you. Every girl I met last night I tried to think looked like you if she was nice, only none of them could be as good looking. There's only one best-looking girl in the world to every man. You're that to me. Write as often as you can for I sure appreciate only a line.\n\nMost sincerely,\n Harry,Return in Five Days to\nLee-Huckins Hotel\nOklahoma City, Okla.\n                                                                             Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n                                                                                  Independence     \n                                                                                                              Mo.,"

I have your picture in my pocket now you sent me to Doniphan and it sure makes me homesick sometimes when I look at it.  Here's hoping I'll see the original before Easter.  I dreamed last night I was going down Delaware.  It was a disappointment to wake up and see the same old iron shack and rock pile over me I tell you.\n\nI was censoring letters today when I ran across this sentence by one of my best sergeants.

He didn't know I was going to read it, I guess, because I make my second lieutenants censor all the mail but they got behind.

    "content": ",[Lawton, Okla.]\n\nFeb. 11, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nYour letters were all waiting for me when I got back and I got one last night. I hope you got my last Oklahoma City letter Sunday. (Filled my pen here. It's always dry when I need it.) I have been going like a horse since I got back. Went over and took some special instructions on gas protection. Had to take a mask like a diver's and get into it and then go into the gas house and sit there ten minutes. Some of the men were very uneasy about going on. They,were afraid they'd get gassed and never see the Kaiser. I don't see that it makes any very great difference where a person gets gassed or shot either provided he's slated for either one, because the same result takes place. Still I reckon there's more honor in getting battle wounds than training ones. Don't you worry about what's going to happen to me because there's not a bullet molded for me nor has Neptune any use for me. Had I have been on,boat that went down, I'd have been in Dublin by this time with some Irish woman at a dance (if she looked like you) or taking a look for the man who invented corks and corkscrews. Ireland's a great country so they say.\n\nMr. Lee is back and says that he sure likes the sound of your voice over the phone. I told him that he had good judgement [sic] and so have I. You don't know what I'd give to see you or even listen to your voice over the phone. You know what, the poet says that Spring time does for young men.\n\nI can't imagine why my letters arrive unsealed because I am always very careful to given them an extra pat at both ends. This one will surely get there sealed. Col Klemm was here today. He seemed very glad to see me and so did Col Elliott. They go to the School of Fire today for ten weeks.\n\nPlease wire me if you get sick because I am terribly uneasy,if I think the least thing is the matter. I am going to wire you tomorrow if I don't hear that you are all right. For goodness sake don't worry about me. I have so much to do I can't be into meanness and when I have a minute I'm writing to you or mamma. I took some sergeants out riding today to show them how to figure a deflection and also how to sit on a horse. We rode up Signal Mtn and down again and one or two were very glad to get back to camp.,One of them informed me that he would stand up to rest for a couple of days. I must be getting to be a tough guy because I don't get tired and I can ride all day without unpleasantness. I have decided to make good and not get an efficiency test (therefore I may get it). You know very well you wouldn't have me home for that even as badly as I'd like to come and you'd like to have me. I'd be forever disgraced. They may have to send,me to the supply department or some where like that but I don't reckon they'll give me a test just yet.\n\nI wanted to come home last Sunday so badly I nearly did anyway. I guess I was too cautious but if I'd get kick out for disobedience it would be worse than the other way. I am writing under difficulty. My board keeps slipping and if I go to the canteen I'll have so much conversation I can't write.\n\nPlease send me a wire or letter to let me know you are all in good health and spirits and not doing any worrying over a good-for-nothing person like me. I am awfully glad you think I'm well enough without a D.S.O. because I'll never get one. The Huns can't run fast enough to catch me. I don't think they could make another like yourself because perfection comes but once.\n\nYours always, \nHarry,[ink stamped: \"Offered at address ___ at  _11a_M\n                                Cause of non-delivery\n                                 ___ no response___\"]\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n                                                                                  Independence     \n                                                                                                              Mo.,[postmarked: \"Independence Feb 12 11AM 1918 Rec'd \"]"

    "content": ",Somewhere in France\nNovember 2, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nYour letter of the eighth came today written on Treasury Department stationery, and I am sure glad to get it. You must be a wonderful solicitor and money getter to be made manager of the drive. Should we decide to promote some of my numerous oil leases when I return, I shall know whom to elect secretary and money-getter.\n\nI am most awful sorry to hear of Dave Winton's death. He was certainly a fine kid and it doesn't seem possible that he is dead. That Spanish grippe must be a fright. I'm not bragging,but my battery hasn't a sick man in it and has not had for several days now. This seems to be a healthy place except for diseases caused by Fritz's iron ration he sometimes heaves this way.\n\nI am glad Mrs. Sands thinks well of me but I can't for the life of me see why she should. I busted her boy and transferred him to another organization and simply wrote a letter to Washington D.C. about the allotment and I guess was lucky enough to get into the right pigeon hole with it and some armchair warmer accidently got it when he took his feet off the desk and it had the desired result. Uncle Joe Cannon says the reason officers in Washington wear spurs is to keep their feet from slipping off the desk and I guess it's right.,I am sending you (under separate cover, as the mail order house says) a package which I hope some postal clerk in the A.E.F. doesn't steal, because it is supposed to contain a Christmas present for you. It is not a good present but it is the very best I can do since I can't go to Paris. It is a pair of bronze vases (they're bronze looking anyway really they're plain old brass) made from German 77 shell cases by a Frenchman here on the front. They will be rather unusual anyway, whether they are pretty or useful or not, and I hope that you'll think of the thought,and not look too hard at the present, always considering that it arrives at all. I am hoping that I can give you a better one next time, or make up for the lack of this one on February 13.\n\nI am enclosing you, also under separate cover, a Stars and Stripes. It is a very hard thing to get papers up here but I sent my efficient second lieutenant to town today and he succeeded in landing one, as well as some Saturday Evening Posts and some late Paris papers, all of which we appreciated highly. Mary tells me that she was elected to be treasurer of the 129th Auxiliary without a dissenting voice, which is very nice. She also seems to be on the point of purchasing a Dodge coupe. Well, I don't care if she does, but I'll bet four bits she backs out when it comes,to handing out the money for it. I am sending her a piece of German brass also made by a Frenchman into a powderbox. Face not guns. She said she purchased a couple of Liberty bonds. Did you solicit her? I have never bought any Liberty bonds yet because I've always seemed to need all the francs and centimes I could rake together to lend to worthless birds in this regiment. I'll have enough to start a French bank or buy a Paris lot or something if I ever get it all collected up, which I don't,ever expect to do. Maybe I can make them collect votes for me when I go to run for Congress on my war record \"when I get tired chasing that mule up this corn row, as I told you, I am going to.\nI am glad you don't hold it against me when I can't write but there have been times, and there will be again, when I couldn't possibly write. I have gone as much as sixty hours without any sleep and for twenty-two days straight I marched every night. You know that's not conducive to letter writing however badly you want to write.

    "content": ",Somewhere in France November 1, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI have just finished putting 1,800 shells over on the Germans in the last five hours. They don't seem to have had enough energy to come back yet. I don't think they will. One of their aviators fell right behind my Battery yesterday and sprained his ankle, busted up the machine, and got completely picked by the French and Americans in the neighborhood. They even tried to take their (there were two in the machine) coats. One of our officers, I am ashamed to say, took the boots off of the one with the sprained ankle and kept them.\nThe French, and Americans too for that matter, are souvenir crazy. If a,guard had not been placed over the machine, I don't doubt that it would have been carried away bit by bit. What I started to say was that the German lieutenant yelled \"La guerre fini\" as soon as he stepped from the machine. He then remarked that the war would be over in ten days. I don't know what he knew about it or what anyone else knows but I am sure that most Americans will be glad when it's over and they can get back to God's country again. It is a great thing to swell your chest out and fight for a principle but it gets almighty tiresome sometimes. I heard a Frenchman remark that Germany was fighting for territory, England for the sea, France for patriotism, and Americans for souvenirs. Yesterday,made me think he was about right.\n\nI got a letter of Commendation, capital C, from the commanding general of the 35th Division. The ordnance repair department made a report to him that I had the best-conditioned guns after the drive that he had seen in France. The general wrote me a letter about it. My chief mechanic is to blame, not me. He knows more about guns than the French themselves. As usual in such cases, the C.O. gets the credit. I think I shall put an endorsement on the letter stating the ability of my chief mechanic and stick it in the files anyway.,I am going to keep the original letter for my own personal and private use. It will be nice to have someday if some low-browed north-end politician tries to remark that I wasn't in the war when I'm running for eastern judge or something. I'll have the \"papers\" and can shut him up. If ever I get home from this war whole (I shall), I am going to be perfectly happy to follow a mule down a corn row the balance of my days - that is, always providing such an arrangement is also a pleasure to you. I think the green pastures of Grand Old Missouri are the best looking of any that I have seen in this world yet and I've seen several brands. The outlook I have now is,a rather dreary one. There are Frenchmen buried in my front yard and Huns in the back yard and both litter up the landscape as far as you can see. Every time a Boche shell hits in a field over west of here it digs up a piece of someone. It is well I'm not troubled by spooks.\n\nI walked out to the observation post the other day (yesterday) to pick an adjusting point and I found two little flowers alongside the trench blooming right in the rock. I am enclosing them. The sob sisters would say that they came from the battle-scarred field of Verdun. They,were in sight and short range of Heinie and were not far from the two most famous forts of his line of defense. You can keep them or throw them away but I thought they'd be something. One's a poppy, the other is a pink or something of the kind. A real sob sister could write a volume about the struggle of these pretty little flowers under the frowning brows of Douaumont the impregnable.\n\nPlease keep writing, for I look for letters eagerly even if I don't write them as often as I should.

I got a letter last Tuesday saying that you didn't feel well and I have been expecting every day to hear you were worse. I hope that you are not and that everything is all as it should be. I haven't heard from home,for a week either. They played me a bad trick at the bank up there the other day. My good friend Booth called a four-thousand-dollar loan on me. Maybe you think I didn't unburden my mind on him. I am going to show him a thing or two some of these days.\n\nI went out to fire the other day along with the rest of the regiment's officers and by some hook or crook I was unlucky enough to observe more shots correctly than anyone else,and now I have to fire next time. I'm scared green because General Berry always eats 'em alive after they fire. He's very expert at making a person shake in his boots. Captain Pete was second and Lieutenant Paterson was third. There was evidently some mistake in grading the papers because you know very well that a person with a half- baked eyesight like mine couldn't see more shots correctly than one with real eyes. Anyway I'm the goat. I guess it's very good experience though.\n\nIf I don't hear from you very soon I'm going to disgrace the service by going A.W.O.L. and finding out what's the matter. There was some joy in life when I got letters from home and from you, but when they come from bankers and I am ordered to show my ignorance before the whole regiment, there's not much left.

We sit around these battery positions and wait for something to shoot at and make maps and do so many things that are necessary and a lot that are not that I sometimes don't know straight up from cross ways. You know the battery commander is the man to who \"the buck\" is passed both going up and comming down, and he's got to watch his Ps & Qs mighty smartly if they don'g succeed,in getting something on him. So far I have been very lucky in that I have had no one gassed, have not been shelled in any of my positions (and I've occupied several in the last month) and I haven't shot up our infantry yet - at least I haven't done it so they could catch me at it. I went out to the front line trenches yesterday and adjusted my battery for range and deflection with ten shots. It used to take at least 48 when I was at school. But when you know that some Hun plase is just laying for you to catch you shooting so he can run home and tell a gas battery about you, it does not take so long nor so many shots to adjust with as you'd use under other conditions. There is an old,battery of 155 long guns across the road from me whose date of manufacture was so long ago that no one knows it. They shoot gas at the Hun every time he fires this way and it seems that their work is very effective because the Hun usually ceases to fire when this astiquator outfit starts. The Frenchmen say that the old guns shoot very accurately. I have paper windows in my dugout and the concussion from the guns has completely ruined it. You should see the palace I live in. It is a different one from that in which I was when I wrote you last. I have a very large arched room which contains the battery kitchen. On one side I have a small room with a store, a table a chair some boxes, a lot of maps and firing tables and other necessary Battery Commander junk. On the other I have a sleeping apartment with room for myself & two lieutenants and a store. The battery is up the road a couple of hundred meters and so well hidden that I can't find it myself after dark sometimes. I have a telephone right at my bedside and one on my desk so that when banages and things are called for I can be immediately informed. I have all the comforts of home except that I'll have such a habit of sleeping underground that I'll have to go to the cellar to sleep when I get home.\nI was in the most famous war town in France today, unless its the one where the King of France was,[pre-printed] AMERICAN Y.M.C.A.\nON ACTIVE SERVICE WITH THE AMERICAN EXPEDITIONARY FORCE [/pre-printed]\n\ncrowned. I walked in and I've never seen a more desolate sight. Trees that were once most beautiful forest trees are stumps with naked branches sticking out making them look like ghosts. The ground is simply one mass of shell holes. They say the Hun shot them 1000000 a day when he was trying, under the Crown Prince to come through. The French simply put 75s hub to hub and moved them down like hay when they started across. When I arrived in town there was not a building that hadn't a shell hole in it. although the old arched gateway is still standing just as it always has. Both towers of the cathedral are still,intact but the rest of it is a mass of ruins. There is not a civilian in town nothing but soldiers, mostly yanks.\nWhen I was going in I saw some railway guns firing. They can shoot 15 or 20 miles and not start to strain their ability to shoot. I am hoping that these were sending messages to ?.\nThe news sure looks well today. When [?] [underline-] begs [/underline] our grand President for the privilege of peace it really looks like something. I'm for peace but that gang should be given a bayonette peace and be made to pay for what they've done to France. I am sure that this desolate country was cultivated and beautiful like the rest of France and now, why Safara or Arizona would look like,Eden beside it. When the moon rises behind those tree trunks I spoke of while ago you can imagine that the ghosts of the 1/2 million Frenchmen who were slaughtered here are holding a sorrowful parade able the ruins.  It makes you hope that His Satanic Majisty has a particularly hot poker and warm corner for Bill Hohenyollern when his turn comes to be judged and found wanting.\n\nI am still bearing that charmed life and since Austria has grit I guess. I've a good more than 2 to 1 chance of getting home with it. I've been places though since I told you I had a charmed life that thoroughly convinced me I have. I attribute it to your prayers. Things that happened to us in the drive sure made believers out of most of us.\nI wish I could have been at the last sale It made me homesick to read of it. The clipping about Elma and the one about Ralph and myself were interesting too.  I saw Ralph the other day. I guess he'll be a major soon. He's some officer. I can tell you a good story of him someday.

    "content": ",Lawton, Okla. [Feb. 22, 1918]\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThis day has been a bright one. So was yesterday. I got your letter both days, and I have been the delinquent party this week. I hope you won't blame me when I tell you what has been happening. The overseas detachment is again having spasms of preparation to leave. I am still on it, thank heaven, and so of course I am having spasms too. I had a regular one yesterday when Colonel Danford,ordered me up before an examining board not for efficiency but for promotion. I think I failed miserably because General Berry was so gruff and discourteous in his questions that I forgot all I ever knew and couldn't answer him. He said, \"Eh huh! You don't know, do you? I thought so. You don't know. That'll be all, outside.\" He kept me and the two others, Lieutenant Paterson and Lieutenant Marks, standing out in the cold so long that we took a terrific cold and I couldn't get up this,morning for reveille. I got up for breakfast and outside of a slight headache I am all in good health and spirits. That is as good spirits as could be expected in a man when he falls down on an examination. We had no opportunity for preparation and I suppose that it would have been no better if we had. I have been looking for them to say that it was a mistake and that an efficiency board is what I needed instead of an examining one. Please don't say anything about it until the announcement is made as to whether I get the promotion or not. If I don't get it then we won't say anything. If I do then we can tell it. I guess it is a compliment anyway to get ordered up even if I didn't pass. They almost sent me home on a physical, too, yesterday but I talked past the M.D. He turned my eyes down twice and threatened to send me to division headquarters for a special examination and then didn't. I guess I can put a real good conversation when circumstances,demand it. You see by taking everything together if I hadn't gotten your letters, I'd sure have been a blue person. In addition to all the other things I did yesterday I turned the exchange over to Captain Butterfield and sat on a general court martial. Some day, wasn't it? Can you wonder that I didn't get up for reveille and still have a slight headache?\n\nI shall cable you as soon as I arrive in Europe. I thought I told you I would once before. I intended to anyway. I am,glad Uncle William was landed safely and I hope to see him when I get across. I don't know much to tell you about leaving, but I'll let you know immediately I start. I shall also let you know if I get the two bars. Please don't say anything about that though until I hear that I'm turned down, which is what we all think. I am no longer Trumanheimer. Did I tell you I met a pretty girl in Guthrie who was nice to me until someone sold her my name was,Trumanheimer, and then she wouldn't look at me anymore. She thought I surely must be of Hebraic descent with that name. She of course didn't know that it is little I care what she thinks or doesn't.\n\nPlease write me as often as possible because the days are sure brighter and not so hard when your letters come.\n\nI think of you always.\nYours, \nHarry\n\nWit M.

    "content": ",[February 26, 1918]\n\nDear Bess: \n\nYour two letters came yesterday and made me feel real good because yesterday was the meanest day we've had since last October. The dust was so thick you could hardly breath. We had a Brigade Review. The men had to pitch shelter tents and make their blankets down in all the dust while the Division Commander and Inspector General looked on to see if they could. It was some Review. I never saw so much Artillery,all together in my life. Things went off nicely in spite of the weather. This morning is a real spring day. The Battery is on guard and I don't have to work much. Since I turned the Exchange over I don't have a whole lot to do at night except study. I am rather at sea to know what to do with the evening from 10 o'clock to midnight so I've been going to bed. We had to get up at 4 o'clock yesterday in order to be in line at 7:30. We get up at 6:15 on regular,days. The overseas detachment is having special drills every day now and I have an idea that they will be pulling out of here very soon. You never can tell though because we thought the same way last month. I wrote Mr. Booth the meanest letter I ever wrote a banker and he agreed to renew my note. I was in a wrathy mood that day and I wrote one to Morgan & Co that rather got sent to them and they came across in a handsome manner. I guess it pays to be mean sometimes. I am going to have a ripping disposition I'm afraid when the war is over.\n\nThe General told Lt. Marks last night that he passed. That gives me hope for he didn't answer any more questions than I did. I do wish I could step in and see you now. I'll bet you are sure lonesome with everyone gone to Platte. I guess Webster really lost out I saw him in the Battery yesterday. They well me it was because of his size. Please write as often as you can and I'll do my level best to write real often. I'm glad you saw the vision of the two bars. It makes me feel like winning.\n\nYours always,\nHarry.,[postmarked: \"LAWTON FEB 26 12-30 PM OKLA\"]\n\n\n\n                                                                             Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n                                                                                  Independence     \n                                                                                                              Mo.,"

    "content": ",Lawton, Okla. Mar. 3, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nYour letter came today twice, making this some grand day even if I did nearly freeze this morning going out to watch the Battery fire. We get out and fire every other day now. I think I told you I fired Wednesday. I did not fire today but had to watch some captains and lieutenants from the 128th fire our Battery. They made quite a mess of it principly (I don't know how to spell any more, never did in fact) because they were scared green. It is some job to get up before some dozen of officers and perhaps a couple,of generals and three artillery colonels who are experts at the game and tell a Battery just exactly what to do with itself. You know that every time you open your mouth the Battery is going to do something and that there are seven separate and distinct things you've got to do exactly right or the colonel who is conducting the problem will blow the whistle on you. If you get those seven things off without a bobble, the Battery shoots bing, bing, bing, bing,,at two-second intervals and all four of the shots insist on staying in the air about an hour and when they do burst maybe they are crossed up like a cross-eyed pup and No. 1 is going where 4 should be. It takes exactly seven and one-half seconds for the shots to go three thousand yards, but it seems like hours. Well you look at the target and the devilish crossfire and lick your lips and look at the target again and cuss a little very quietly to yourself and bust out with some wild command and the colonel blows the whistle on you and then the general summons the whole world around to pick you to pieces and perhaps ask if you have any brains. He wasn't there when I fired so I got away better than some, but the foregoing is the usual procedure. It's really heartbreaking the way some awful smart men simply blow up when they fire the first time. After doing it once you don't care a hang what happens and it usually,comes out as it should.\n\nSay I sure feel all stuck up that you would miss a trip to Platte on the chance of seeing me. I'd give all I possess to see you once more before going across. I got a good and well founded rumor that we might leave before Monday. I have all my grips packed and ready. You may be sure that I will wire you post haste the moment we get started. Don't put any faith in the wild stories you hear floating around Independence because that C Battery bunch,never seem to get anything straight and as far as I'm able to judge they write home all those rumors just for effect. You may rest assured that if I, who am on the special detail and know everything that goes and comes about it, don't know when we leave or where we are going it is a certainty that no enlisted man is going to know. I was informed today by the commander of the detachment that he had a wire from Sec Baker,saying we would entrain as soon as the commander of the Port of Embarkation ordered us to, and for us to be ready any minute. I put that down to mean about ten days or so or it might on a long chance mean Monday. Don't you worry about me. I am going to come back and I hope knowing more and worth more to you and everyone else than when I went away. We won't be sunk or destroyed or anything else and I think I should maker a Battery hit a Hun right in the eye, at least I hope to.\n\nI'm sure glad to get your letters and I hope I can go to Hoboken by way of K.C. and come back the same way.\n\nYours always, \nHarry,Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n                                                                                  Independence     \n                                                                                                              Mo.,"

I received seven, count 'em, seven letters from you, five from Mary, one from Boxley one from Blair and a card from Miss Maggie.  I got them at noon today at regimental headquarters and then I had to come back to Battalion Hqrs and have a school for two hours and then read letters from home.  I saved yours until last because I wanted the most possible enjoyment and worked things on a climax basis.

I wrote you yesterday but I couldn't possibly fail to write again today even if something pops in the Battalion.  For fear you won't get the other letter I'll have to tell you that I'm a real Capitan in Uncle Sam's Armee.  Didn't know it until I got back to the regiment.  I am Adjutant of the second Battalion.  Some job; I have to teach school and do a lot of things I never thought I could.\n\nI haven't heard of any of the 129th Field Artillery running away with French girls.  Most of us have too much work to do to think of French girls and besides, speaking personally, when I'm not working my mind is occupied with a girl in USA of a kind they don't make in France or anywhere else.  Gee I wish I could see you but our work is cut out for us and the sooner we accomplish our task the better for all the world and the sooner we'll get home.  Americans are sure well thought of in France now and always will be I hope. \n\nIt's sure good to hear of your going to the Shubert, driving down the country roads east of the world's capital (Independence) and doing other things like that.  How I wish I could have been along.\n\nI sure want that shirt but under present orders I guess I can't have it.  No packages whatever will be shipped according to present instructions.  Maybe they'll loosen up later and send us some.  If they do be sure and send it.  I still have the sweater you knitted for me and it is as good as new although I've worn it a lot and certainly did appreciate it on the voyage over and will use it a lot about two months from now.\n\nI think I told you I almost saw Bill Bostian.  He was at the Machine Gun School right close to our school.  He was in the Y.M.C.A. just a short time before I came in but left before I saw him.  I saw in the paper where he was in Paris a short time afterward.\n\nI just barely sneaked through at the school and now they've got me teaching trig. & Logrithims  and surveying and engineering and a lot of other high brow stuff that nearly cracks my head open to learn just before class and then if some inquisitive nut asks me a question I'm up the creek and usually answer him by telling him he's ahead of the schedule and I'll tell him tomorrow.  Then I'm safe to look it up and still have my prestige.  Some system I claim.\n\nYou wanted to know if I get plenty to eat.  I should say I do.  Though I would give six months pay (and I get about 2 bushels of francs every month) for one Sunday dinner at your house.  When we were at school we knew exactly what we were going to get every meal before it was served.  For breakfast we had omelette (the French say om e lette? Just like they are asking you something.  They say choc e lette? the same way) oatmeal coffee and jam with brown bread, for dinner we had roast horse (it was beef really) very thin gravy, jam and bread with fromage and butter and brown bread.  The bread is sure good.  I wish I could get that kind now.  You can eat a peck of it and not get tired of it.  We'd have soup and the same at supper.  There was always a sufficiency but I got so tired of that same old French flavor to everything that when I got back to the regiment and went down to the Supply Co mess and they gave me stewed tomatoes, prunes rice and some honest to goodness American coffee I thought it was the best meal I'd ever eaten.  If I could come in to your house for dinner you'd probably have to send for a doctor when I got done doing justice to pie and cake and ice cream.  I am getting fat over here though and walking about fifteen miles a day so I guess the food certainly agrees with me.  I never felt better in my life.  I'm going to have my likeness struck off on one of these French cameras if we stay here long enough, captains bars, go to cap, Samuel Brown belt and everything.  It's just like harnessing a horse now when I go to dress.  I look like Siam's King on a drunk when I get that little cockeyed cap stuck over one ear, a riding crop in my left hand a whipcord suit and a strut that knocks 'em dead (except that there's no one to fall for it).

It isn't as bad as I thought it would be but it's bad enough.  The heroes are all in the infantry.  When a man goes up with them he really does something.  We are only their supporters and don't get much real action.  The easiest and safest place for a man to get is in the air service.  They fly around a couple of hours a day, sleep in a featherbed every night, eat hotcakes and maple syrup for breakfast, pie and roast beef for supper every day, spend their vacations in Paris or whoever else it suits their fancy, and draw 20 percent extra pay for doing it.  Their death rate is about like the quartermaster and ordnance departments and on top of it all they are dubbed the heroes of the war.  Don't believe it, the infantry—our infantry—are the heroes of the war.  There's nothing—machine guns, artillery, rifles, bayonets, mines, or anything else—that can stop them when they start.  If we could keep up with them, they'd go to the Rhine in one swoop.  The Prussian Guards simply can't make their legs stand when the word comes to them that the Yanks are coming.  They move on, what's left of 'em.  \n\nI saw some clippings where \"Maj. Carr and \"Capt\" Rainey had been taking the town at home.

The inspector looked us over and sent us back to camp. He is still here looking around. I suppose his report to Washington will affect the moving of the Division.

I am very sorry to have been so long but things have happened to me so rapidly I couldn't write.  There was no chance to mail them if I could have.  The great drive has taken place and I had a part in it, a very small one but nevertheless a part.  The experience has been one that I can never forget, one that I don't want to go through again unless the Lord will but I'd never have missed for anything.  The papers are in the street now saying that the Central Powers have asked for peace, and I was in the drive that did it!  I shot out a German Battery, shot up his big observation post, and ruined another Battery when it was moving down the road.  My excellent Second Lieutenant Zemer and myself were in the front of the infantry lines while I was doing it, and I saw tanks take towns and everything else that there is to see.  I brought my Battery forward under fire and never lost a horse nor a man.  Had shells fall on all sides and I am as sure as I am sitting here that the Lord was and is with me.  I'm not yet dizzy although one or two men in the regiment are.  \n\nWe are in billets now resting up and I suppose we'll go back in when they need us.  I am as fat, healthy, and look as well as I ever did, so don't worry about me because there is no German shell with my name on it.  I am glad Fred is going to the university as I believe it is a necessity to a man these days.  I've had a university education and then some in the last year.  Being a Battery commander is an education in itself.  I don't know if I have made a successful one or not, but we've been in and out a couple of times together and I still have the Battery.  There were a couple of men hurt this last time but they were not with me, they were on special detail with the ammunition train.  \n\nIf this peace talk is true and we do get to come home soon, I can tell you a lot of things I can't write down.  You will probably hear more than you wish.  \n\nEdgar Hinde has been sick with throat trouble.  They sent him to a hospital for treatment and when he came out sent him to another regiment.  I don't know where he is now.\n\nI am very glad the 129th Aux did so well at the fair.  Perhaps you can use the proceeds to give us a home coming.  Would you meet me in N.Y. and go to the Little Church Around the Corner if I get sent home?  We can then go east or west or any old direction you wish for a tour.  I have an idea if peace comes that it will be six months before we can get home.  I got three letters from you today and I surely did appreciate them.  I got three also while I was right up under the German guns and I tell you it sure bolstered up my nerve.  We were on the most famous battlefield of the war, in front of the town the Germans couldn't take, and were against the Kaiser's pick but they ran just the same.

    "content": "Dear Bess:\n\nThis is Sunday morning and a magnificent one but we all have the blues.  They have taken Colonel Danford away from us, sent him to Washington to report to the artillery commander-in-chief.  I don't know what for, unless it is to be a general or something because he knows more artillery than Napoleon Bonaparte himself.  The whole regiment is feeling badly over it.  Captain McGee told his first sergeant about it as they were walking to the stable.  The sergeant stopped and said \"The H—l?\"  The captain told the colonel about it and it nearly pleased him to death.  He sent for me yesterday and practically gave me his horse, a fine Kentucky-bred saddle animal, pretty as a picture and gentle as a dog.  He's a very dark sorrel with a dark sorrel mane and tail and a pretty, little intelligent head like Rosa Bonheur puts on her horses.  I got him for one hundred dollars.  He'd be cheap at three hundred dollars.  Colonel Klemm and Major Miles were both peeved because they didn't get him.  Colonel Klemm said to me the first thing when he found I had the horse, \"You lucky Jew you get all the plums that fall, don't you?\"  I told him I took them when they were thrown at me.  I don't know why the colonel picked me for the bargain, but he did.  I am going to ship the horse home along with Colonel Elliott's and Colonel Klemm's and keep him.  He's too fine to take to war.  \n\nI have made Masons out of both Colonel Klemm and Colonel Danford since we've been here, so I guess maybe that helps my drag somewhat, although it's not supposed to.  General Berry is one and I am going to help make General Wright one next Wednesday if he shows up as expected and I'm still here.  That's the one thing I've studied in the last years that has done me more good than anything, except artillery study.  This letter doesn't seem very nice to me.  I haven't been able to talk of anything but myself and then have said nothing.  I sold Lizzie to a poor sucker yesterday for two hundred dollars, which I consider as a find in the road, because I'd already charged her off to profit and loss, less the profit end.  My former Jew clerk in the canteen watched me make the sale and then told me that he still had something to learn in salesmanship. The canteen declared another three-thousand-dollar dividend the first and paid back the investment besides.  That is only earning at the rate of 621 percent a year.  Sounds like Standard Oil.  Colonel Danford told me I had made a reputation in the devilish thing that I'd have a hard time living down.  I am going to horseback ride over the Medicine Park this afternoon and look at it because I don't ever expect to come back to this place again if I live to be a thousand.  \n\nI am very glad that Chandler Wright thinks well of me.  I always try to treat all the men in the Battery just as I'd like them to treat me if our places were reversed, and it seems to work very well.  \n\nWrite as often as you can because I may stay here another month.  Dinner is ready and I must run.  \n\nYours always,\nHarry,Dear Bess:-\n\nThis is Sunday morning and a magnificent one but we all have the blues.

It has been raining almost continually for a week and today is sunshine.  Day before yesterday was a grand surprise for me.  I got a letter from you.  I don't know how it ever caught up with me because I have been moving around some.  It is the great adventure and I am in it.  We haven't done anything but be in reserve but I am hoping for a shot most every day.  My Battery was examined by the chief ordnance officer the other day and he said it was in the best condition of any in France, and he has seen them all.  That referred to the guns.  I was somewhat swelled up but the chief mechanic deserves the credit.  His name is McKinley Wooden and he is the straightest, stiffest soldier I have.  It almost hurts me when he stands at attention to talk to me.  I am plumb crazy about my Battery.  They sure step when I ask them to.  We had to get ready for a night march a day or two ago and my bunch beat the regiment by nearly a half hour.  At Coetquidan we always won every competition there was to win and then the colonel gives me h (excuse me) every chance he gets.  He says that is what he is for and I guess it is.  There is no other need of him that I can see.  He likes me pretty well though and I get along fine with him.  \n\nI am having some very interesting experiences, some of which will do to tell of at a later date.  They gave me a new lieutenant yesterday, a second, from the school at Saumur.  He's been in France a year, has two gold stripes, is a fine looker, and seems to have horse sense (a hard thing to get in lieutenants).  I now have four, two first and two seconds.  They are all efficient and that is the reason I have such good luck.  Lieutenant Householder is from Kansas and is also a training-camp man.  Lieutenant Jordon is from the plains of Texas, has a Southern drawl, is tall and has brown eyes.  He can ride anything that has a back to sit on and is my horse lieutenant.  He moves the Battery with skins and cripples when it has to be done that way.  My other second lieutenant is named Eagleton.  He's from Okla. and has not as much training as the rest but he's a good man and runs my kitchen and supplies.  My Saumur graduate is from Chicago and is named Zemer.  I sit back and inform them (the lieutenants) and my sergeants what I want done, and it is.  My noncoms, now, are whizzes.  I sorted 'em over, busted a lot and made a lot.  They've gotten so they don't know whether to trust my smile or not, because I smile when I bust 'em and the same when I make 'em.  \n\nArrowsmith is still along but I hardly ever see him.  He is regimental telephone officer and is a very busy man these days.  I am also rater chasing around and he don't often see me.  I am surely glad.  I'm here and I wouldn't be anywhere else for all there is except one of course and you know where that is.  We are doing our best to finish the job and get home but we can't leave until it's done.

    "content": "Somewhere in Parle-Vous\nSeptember 1, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI am the most pleased person in the world this morning.  I got two letters from you and have accomplished my greatest wish.  Have fired five hundred rounds at the Germans at my command, been shelled, didn't run away thank the Lord, and never lost a man.  Probably shouldn't have told you but you'll not worry any more if you know I'm in it than if you think I am.  Have had the most strenuous week of my life, am very tired but otherwise absolutely in good condition physically, mentally, and morally.\n\nIt has been about two weeks since I've written you because I haven't had the chance.  They shipped me from school to the front in charge of Battery D and the Irish seem to be pleased over it.  We went into position right away and fired five hundred rounds at them in thirty-six minutes.  Two of my guns got stuck in the mud, it was dark and raining, and before I could get away bing came the reply.  I sent two of the pieces to safety, the horses on the other two broke away and ran every which direction but my Irishmen stayed with me, except a few drivers who were badly scared and my first sergeant.  We covered up the two guns I had stuck with branches and things, and one of my lieutenants—Housholder is his name—and myself then collected up all the horses we could and got the men together, caught up with the other two pieces and went to safety.  I slept for twenty-four hours afterwards and am now back of the lines awaiting another chance.  I went back the next night and got my guns.  Every man wanted to go along but I took only the two sections who belonged to the guns.\n\nMy greatest satisfaction is that my legs didn't succeed in carrying me away, although they were very anxious to do it.  Both of my lieutenants are all wool and a yard wide.  One of them, Jordon by name, came back with the horses off the other two pieces to pull me out, and I had to order him off the hill.  Four horses were killed, two of them outright and two had to be shot afterwards.\n\nI am in a most beautiful country and it seems like a shame that we must spread shells over it, but as the French say Boches are hogs and should be killed.  Please don't worry about me because no German shell is made that can hit me.  One exploded in fifteen feet of me and I didn't get a scratch, so you can see I have them beaten there.  I would give most anything to see you this Sunday morning.  The piece you sent me about Mary is very fine.  She is a very able sister and I hope sometime to send her to Europe or anywhere else she wants to go in return for running things as she has.\n\nI am so sleepy I can't hardly hold my eyes open but will write again as soon as I can.\n\nKeep writing.  They are like stars seen in the blue waves that roll nightly on deep Galilee (your letters)—as my pet poet says of the Assyrians (not a very appropriate application, but you know the meaning anyway).\n\nYours always\nHarry\n\nHarry S Truman\nCapt 129 FA\nAmerican E F.\n\nRemember me to your mother and George & Frank and May & Natalie & Fred.,Somewhere in Parle Vous\nSept 1, 1918\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nI am the most pleased person in the world this morning.

Have had the most strenuous week of my life, am very tired but otherwise absolutely in good condition physically, mentally, and morally.\n\nIt has been about two weeks since I've written you because I haven't had the chance.  They shipped me,from school to the front [start underscore] in charge of Battery D [end underscore] and the Irish seem to be pleased over it.  We went into position right away and fired five hundred rounds at them in thirty-six minutes.  Two of my guns got stuck in the mud, it was dark and raining, and before I could get away bing came the reply.  I sent two of the pieces to safety, the horses on the other two broke away and ran every which direction but my Irishmen stayed with me, except a few drivers who were badly scared and my first sergeant.  We covered up the two guns I had stuck with branches and things, and one of my lieutenants—Housholder is his name—and myself then collected up all the horses we could and got the men together, caught up with the other two pieces and went to safety.  I slept for twenty-four hours afterwards and am now back of the lines awaiting another chance.  I went back the next night and got my guns.  Every man wanted to go along but,I took only the two sections who belonged to the guns.\n\nMy greatest satisfaction is that my legs didn't succeed in carrying me away, although they were very anxious to do it.  Both of my lieutenants are all wool and a yard wide.  One of them, Jordon by name, came back with the horses off the other two pieces to pull me out, and I had to order him off the hill.  Four horses were killed, two of them outright and two had to be shot afterwards.\n\nI am in a most beautiful country and it seems like a shame that we must spread shells over it, but as the French say Boches are hogs and should be killed.  Please don't worry about me because no German shell is made that can hit me.  One exploded in fifteen feet of me and I didn't get a scratch, so you can see I have them beaten there.  I would give most anything to see you,this Sunday morning.  The piece you sent me about Mary is very fine.  She is a very able sister and I hope sometime to send her to Europe or anywhere else she wants to go in return for running things as she has.\n\nI am so sleepy I can't hardly hold my eyes open but will write again as soon as I can.\n\nKeep writing.  They are like stars seen in the blue waves that roll nightly on deep Galilee (your letters)—as my pet poet says of the Assyrians (not a very appropriate application, but you know the meaning anyway).\n\nYours always\nHarry\n\nHarry S Truman\nCapt 129 FA\nAmerican E F.\n\nRemember me to your mother and George & Frank and May & Natalie & Fred.,[upper left] Harry S Truman / Capt By D 129 FA / American E.

The whole bunch of us went to Monte Carlo day before yesterday and stayed all night.  They won't let soldiers into the casino, nor will they allow anyone who lives or works in any of the towns along the Riviera to play.  It is a gaudy, gorgeous place, just what you'd expect in a place whose sole income is from fleecing tourists and making them gamblers.  The fleecing isn't done at the casino but at the hotels and cafes.  The gambling is on the square but the probable error has been so closely figured that the house wins in the long run.  They let us go in and see the great gambling rooms before ten o'clock in the morning and they are surely furnished in a style you'd expect to find in a place of that kind.  There are velvet hangings, beautiful paintings, and mahogany chairs and tables, a beautiful mahogany bar in a drinking saloon which has Brussels carpet a foot thick on the floor and leather chairs to sit in.  No French theater is complete without a fine bar and a beautiful room to drink in.  Everyone, men, women, and children, are frequenters and every show gives thirty-minute intermissions between each act so the audience can go out and quench its thirst, which it does en masse.  I'll bet that this country drinks enough wine to float the British navy every month.  They use water only to wash in and if a man wants water to drink with his meals, they think he needs a doctor or something.  \n\nThere is a grand hotel in Monte Carlo called Hotel [illegible] Paris, there is a Café de Paris and a museum.  The museum is architecturally beautiful and really looks as if it had walked in from Greece or from somewhere that buildings are made beautiful instead of gaudy.  It is the Mussee Oceanographic.  It is very beautiful and very interesting inside too.  Every kind of sea animal and fish in the world is represented either by a stuffed one, a skeleton, or a live one.  There is a stuffed Polar bear and the skeleton of a whale and a live octopus so you see that most everything is present.  It was started by Prince Albert I of Monaco.  I suppose he wanted at least one Prince of Monaco to be famous for some thing worth while and he is I guess.\n\nMajor Gates and I bought an interest in an automobile and drove to the Italian border and back to Nice by way of the Grand Cornice which I am informed is one of the famous drives of the world.  It was built by the Little Corporal to facilitate his march to Italy.  It is the most beautiful ride I ever had even if I did lose my interest in the machine when the ride was over.

    "content": ",Somewhere in France \nJuly 22, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nThis is a banner day sure enough. I have your letter of July 1 telling of your grandfather's death and remarking that I would probably have to take a day off to read your letter. I have read it over and over. It is certainly a grand day when letters come. I am most awfully sorry to hear of your grandfather's death but it is something that we can't help and that we can only accept the best way we can. I hope your mother is well by this time. I am looking for the picture of you and all your cousins.\n\nThe Star is rather premature in its announcement of our arrival on the front. It is like Mark Twain said about his death, it is greatly exaggerated. We are further from the,front now than when we were at school. This place is just like Camp Doniphan. We get up at 5 A.M. go out and fire like Sam Hill all morning one week and all afternoon the next and put in the rest of the day drilling the Battery. I told you in my last letter that I am now a Battery Commander.\n\nThey gave me a Battery that was always in trouble and in bad, but we carried off all the credits this week. I hope to make a reputation for myself if the cards fall right and I don't get wounded or something. It is the Irish Battery I have and the adjutant has decided to put an O in front of my name to make me right. They seem to want to soldier for me and if I can get them to do it, I shall consider that I have made the greatest success there is to make. If I fail, it'll be a great failure,too. That's always the case though. The men are as fine a bunch as were ever gotten together but they have been lax in discipline. Can you imagine me being a hard-boiled captain of a tough Irish Battery? I started things in a rough- cookie fashion. The very first man that was up before me for a lack of discipline got everything I was capable of giving. I took the Battery out to fire the next day and they were so anxious to please me and fire good that one of my gunners got the buck ague and simply blew up. I had to take him out. When I talked to him about it he almost wept and I felt so sorry for him I didn't even call him down. Tell George that little Higginbotham is one of my shootin' men. He pulls the hammer on No. 1 gun and he sure rides it. The other day it nearly bucked him off. The thing wasn't set solidly on the ground and as he has to pull the hammer from the right hand side of the gun he insisted on riding it every time because it was easier to reach the lanyard.\nOh glorious day! Another letter of yours just came dated June 27 and telling of your Grandfather's death. I most certainly wish I could have been present to be of assistance in any way I could have. I am hoping most sincerely that your mother is entirely well by this time. Please don't worry about me and I promise I'll work so hard that I won't worry either. I want you to be proud of me and I hope you'll not have to be ashamed because I don't make good. If hard work both mentally and physically count I hope to win. The young second lieuts seem to think I know something about the artillery from the way they ask me questions. I don't know if I do or not but I am going to know before the war is over.\nThe 35th is on the front but we are not with,them nor will we be for some time so don't you worry about our being there. We are further from the front than we have been since we landed except the first week. It is only about a day's horseback ride to the point where the great Cardinal issued his famous Edit against the Hugonots (I don't know how to spell 'em). So you see we are far from the battle line although most of us are anxious to get to it. If I can only get my battery to put shells on the Germans as perfectly as they put them on the target I am sure we will make ourselves felt.\n\nI am very glad Mary and Mamma sent flowers to your grandfather's funeral because I would have done it if I'd been there. I hope your grandmother is well and can take her California trip.\nI don't imagine that Columbia would be a very grand place to spend the winter, although I hope,Fred goes there because I never knew how very valuable a university education is until now, even if I did help Slagle shut up the chappies by telling them that I was a graduate of Moler's Barber College. We told them at artillery school that we belong to the Q.T.F., which meant Quinine Tonic Fraternity, and we never heard any more college yells at that school.\nI am going to send you a picture postcard of me next week if the camera stood the strain.\n\nPlease keep writing and remember I am\nYours always, \nHarry\n\nHarry S Truman\nCapt. 129 F.A.

My hair is not any whiter than it's always been except for a few grey hairs around the edge and they are not visible unless you look closely.

    "content": ",Lawton, Okla. [January 11, 1918]\n\nDear Bess:\n\nGot your letter today and was sure glad to hear from you. I sent you a note from the train but you evidently had not received it yet. We were hours late and there were so many people to get on at Oklahoma City that some of them got left. I was not among them. We got into camp at ten minutes before midnight. That is all the time of my leave that I wasted in camp. They put me on as officer of the day right off the bat and I didn't get any sleep for another day.,get any sleep for another day. This colonel is working the socks off of us. My cold kept getting worse and worse until today. I couldn't talk yesterday and I went out and stayed all day mounted, very nearly froze to death and came in feeling better than I have since I got back. They sent me a general order closing all canteens until they had paid their debts and shown that they are solvent. I passed out the word that last night would see the finish of the canteen,and they almost mobbed the place. Sold six hundred dollars' worth in three hours. I have been working like a nigger ever since getting invoiced and billed out. It seems like you're never up with the hounds in the army.\n\nThere is a terrific blizzard going here. It began raining this morning from the east. It turned to snow and the wind got around in Hiawatha's corner and ice balls began blowing in straight lines like bullets right from Medicine Hat's worst mixture. You can't see ten feet from you now and the wind is blowing about sixty miles an hour. This must be one of the kind I've heard my grandfather speak of when he crossed the plains. This place just sticks up high enough to catch every misting air current that goes from the Arctic to fill,the holes in the Gulf of Mexico. In summer it catches all the dust in the whole of North America. Now we are getting some of Klondike's surplus snow. We were to have been inspected from cellar to garret and clear to the top of the chimney tomorrow but on account of the storm we won't be. This colonel inspects, too, believe me. There are eyes in the back of his head and nothing, absolutely nothing,,gets by unseen. Then he congregates the whole regiment and gives a lecture on what you didn't do so the rest can profit by it. Makes you feel like crawling in a hole and pulling it after you but it gets results.\n\nYou've no idea how short five days are. I have been pinching myself every day saying, well what a grand kidding you gave yourself. I sure wanted to stay another week. If I only could. But I suppose it would have been just as hard to come back in another week as,it was in five days. When I counted up I was only home one hour and thirty minutes one afternoon, four hours another, and part of two nights. Didn't get to talk to Mamma over an hour and never saw you much over that at a time. I didn't know how crazy I was about you until I went to leave. I'd give all I have or ever expect to have to see you tonight. We are getting closer to a move all the time. No telling when it will come. Write as often as you can and I'll do likewise.\n\nYours always, Harry,[postmark stamped: \"LAWTON, OKLA. FT.

    "content": "Dec 26 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nChristmas is over and we had a very nice time. The ladies of the Auxialry sent us 2700 francs about 330 of which my battery got. Capt. Thatcher gave me 500 francs and some of the boys dug up some and we bought a hog. Now what do you reckon that cussed hog cost in honest to goodness money? Just $235.00 dollars, real dollars not francs it was 1291 francs. I hope I choke if ever I pay that much for a squealer again. But it was worth the money. You've no idea how good fresh roast pork tastes when you've been eating canned millie and fresh beef all the time. That was only an incident in the dinner. There was chicken and dumpling (chicken $1.00 a pound) and peach cobler [sic] mashed potatoes jam and bread. That dinner only cost the battery and its friends especially its friends about $500.00. We had that much from Maj. Gates and his adjutant Lt. Younger, Capt Thatcher and doctor whose name I don't know yet and the horse doctor Lt. Parker were out guests. I have an Irishman by the name of Eugene Donnelly who has no respect whatever for rank. He acted as toastmaster and some of us got a wonderful roasting. He missed reveille this morning and is now on the wood pile or cleaning out the stables I don't know which. He's not there you understand on account of his ability as toastmaster but simply because he was delinquent at 6 A.M.\n\nCapt Thatcher made a grand speech. Maj. Gates offered a toast to the Battery and I got tangled up and sat down. My famous prize fighter Tommy Murphy sang some songs and the Irish quartette Keenan, Chaney, Dougherty and Lucas by name sang us some very touching melodies; we had vin rouge by the quart and altogether it was a right successful affair.\n\nTommy Murphy is amature [sic] lightweight champion of America and can knock the stuffing out of anybody in 20 pounds of his weight. He also has a very pleasing voice and an Al Jolson manner that makes a decided hit. When he's in the ring he acts like chained lightning let loose but when he's soldiering the chains are usually on or seem to be. He's a sergeant in fact the senior sergeant of my outfit. Had he not been just Tommy Murphy I expect I'd have busted him long ago. But he's one of my bragging points and I don't do it. Whenever Pete or Caranza (now called Parson Salisbury) get to blowing off I just invite them to produce a man who can whip Tommy and the argument is off. He has the most beautiful and innocent blue eyes and when he's up before me for some delinquency I simply can't treat him mean although I know perfectly well he's working me. I only had three Christmas dinner yesterday, two besides the battery's. The officers mess had one at 5 P.M. or we supposed to but the cook drank up the four gallons of wine we were to have had and was somewhat under the weather when it came to suppertime. In fact he was so far under that it took three guards and a Captain to dislodge him from beneath the kitchen table. Consequently our dinner was an hour late. It was pretty good though, roast duck and mashed potatoes. After supper we went over to the boxing match and wrestling match at the Y.M.C.A. building. My outfit won four of the five events and Tommy was barred. The Irish as a class you know like to fight in the ring or out of it. I thought once that my outfit were going to clean out E Battery en masse but the referee quieted things down and everything went off very smoothly. I didn't have a single personal encounter but Pete had two men shot by a drunk (not seriously hurt) and Parson Salisbury had some rough and tumbles. I think that a couple of Salisbury's men were muddied up by the Irish but they were so dizzy that they couldn't say for sure and I never made any close investigation.\n\nAfter the boxing bouts I went to a dinner given by the 2nd Battalion detail. You know I was once adjutant of 2nd Bn. They had a grand dinner at which I discovered some of my own roast pig and a lot of other dainties including almonds and Bordeaux Vieux a most excellent and satisfying white vintage. Speeches were made by Maj. Gates and some of the men said things about me that made me blush and were not true anyway.\n\nTake it altogether I'll again state that it was a right successful Christmas to be spent so far from anywhere.\n\nMy package has not come but I hope for the next mail to bring it forth.\n\nMy what I'd do or give to get to get to see you this New Years as I did last. Whenever I think of it I am so homesick I nearly die. I am plum crazy to see you. I just love you more than ever and can't help it and don't want to. I am looking for a letter or two or thrice.\n\nYours always\nHarry.\n\nHarry Truman\nCapt Bty D 129 F A\nAmerican E F,[Knights of Columbus/War Activities, printed in blue in center]\n[Knights of Columbus logo on left]\n[United States flag on right]\n\nDec 26 1918\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nChristmas is over and we had a very nice time.

He may be a hero when you next hear of him because you never can tell what a man is made of until he really tries and is tried in the right spot. \n\nWe went out on a picnic hike today and had dinner in the field. You should see me ride at the head of my black horse battery with two buglers behind me and the rest of the battery coming behind just wanting to do as I say. It's enough to make one feel real good especially when the Major tells me that he's pleased with my selection of positions and invites Pete and Salisbury over to see how it should be done.

    "content": "Nov 10, 1918\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nI got a letter today from Boxley and one from Joe Bielsford who was our auditor in Morgan and Company, and none from you.  I am disappointed as a kid who didn't get any candy but I know that Uncle Sam's mail and not you are to blame and maybe I'll get one or two or three tomorrow.  I am still holding down a place in a quiet sector and I'm getting fat on it.  Also that helmet is not going to make me bald headed, at least I don't think so.\n\nThe Hun is yelling for peace like a stuck hog and I hope old daddy Foch makes him yell louder yet or throttles him one.  Throttling would be too easy.  When you see some of the things those birds did and then hear them put up the talk they do for peace it doesn't impress you at all.  A complete and thorough threshing is all they've got coming and take my word they are getting it and getting it right.  \n\nThis has been a beautiful Sunday.  The sun shining and as warm as summer.  It sure made me wish for Lizzie and five gallons of gas with her nose pointed down Blue Ridge Blvd and me stepping on the throttle to get there quickly. I wonder how long it will be before we do any riding down that road.  Easter?  Maybe if not sooner. Heine seems to be about finished. Just to make the day interesting one of their planes came over and shot down one of our sausage balloons and came near getting shot down himself. I shot away about 500 rounds of high explosive shells myself.  Not at the plane but at some Hun machine gun about seven miles away. I don't know if I hit them but I have hopes as I laid the guns very carefully. A Hun plane dropped some bombs not far from my back yard last night and sort of shook things up. They made him run home in a hurry too. There is a big railroad gun about a kilometer behind me that shoots about every fifteen minutes and I heard one of the boys remark that \"There goes another rolling kitchen over to pulverize Jerry.\" The projectile makes a noise like a wagon going down the road when it goes through the air, so the remark was very good.\n\nI have been censoring letters today and it is some job.  I had no idea that there were so many accomplished liars in any organization on earth as I have in mine. They are eternally trying to get by the censor with some big tale of their heroism and accomplishments in this war and they do it too, sometimes, especially if they put in something nice about their commanding officer and the part he took in the tale.

Write as often as you can to one who thinks of you,\n\nAlways,\nHarry,[letterhead: American YMCA On Active Service with the American Expeditionary Force]\n\nNov 10 1918\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nI got a letter today from Boxley and one from Joe Bielsford who was our auditor in Morgan and Company, and none from you.  I am disappointed as a kid who didn't get any candy but I know that Uncle Sam's mail and not you are to blame and maybe I'll get one or two or three tomorrow.  I am still holding down a place in a quiet sector and I'm getting fat on it.  Also that helmet is not going to make me bald headed, at least I don't think so.\n\nThe Hun is yelling for peace like a stuck hog and I hope old daddy Foch makes him yell louder yet or throttles him one.  Throttling would be too easy.  When you see some of the things those birds did and,then hear them put up the talk they do for peace it doesn't impress you at all.  A complete and thorough threshing is all they've got coming and take my word they are getting it and getting it right.  \n\nThis has been a beautiful Sunday.  The sun shining and as warm as summer.  It sure made me wish for Lizzie and five gallons of gas with her nose pointed down Blue Ridge Blvd and me stepping on the throttle to get there quickly. I wonder how long it will be before we do any riding down that road.  Easter?  Maybe if not sooner. Heine seems to be about finished. Just to make the day interesting one of their planes came over and shot down one of our sausage balloons and came near getting shot down himself. I shot away about 500 rounds of high explosive shells myself.  Not at the plane but at some Hun machine gun about seven miles away. I don't know if I,hit them but I have hopes as I laid the guns very carefully. A Hun plane dropped some bombs not far from my back yard last night and sort of shook things up. They made him run home in a hurry too. There is a big railroad gun about a kilometer behind me that shoots about every fifteen minutes and I heard one of the boys remark that \"There goes another rolling kitchen over to pulverize Jerry.\" The projectile makes a noise like a wagon going down the road when it goes through the air, so the remark was very good.\n\nI have been censoring letters today and it is some job.  I had no idea that there were so many accomplished liars in any organization on earth as I have in mine. They are eternally trying to get by the censor with,some big tale of their heroism and accomplishments in this war and they do it too, sometimes, especially if they put in something nice about their commanding officer and the part he took in the tale.  Usually though I have to tear 'em up or send them back when they tell too much or stretch the truth even beyond literary license.  Some of them write very good and very interesting letters and some of them do not.  It is a job to censor them and when my lieutenants get too far behind I help them out.\n\nI hope the base censor doesn't laugh at mine as I sometimes have to at theirs.\n\nHope I get that letter tomorrow.

I am so glad you had such a pleasant visit and I do wish I could have been there with you.  You tell Uncle Strother that I shall certainly get him an iron cross if such a thing is at all attainable.  Should we go into Germany, there is no doubt that they will be plentiful and I can get one.  My outfit picked an aviator who fell near the Battery position just before the close of the war and I learned afterwards that one of 'em got an iron cross of the observer.  He'd already sold it or I'd have made him produce it.  Anyway my abilities as a collector of souvenirs are not very great.  I can't tell what will make a good one and what won't.  Everything looks so very common and useless when you are here and can get most anything for a song.  Some of the men have so much unnecessary stuff, like those coal-scuttle helmets, haversacks, etc., that it would be hard for 'em to carry their clothes.  They'll undoubtedly have to leave most of it behind.  I have the helmet off the first dead Hun I ever saw and I reckon I'll keep that.  That's about all I have that's worth keeping.  I am going to Verdun tomorrow or next day and shall in all probability get the iron cross.  Two of my lieutenants went up to Douaumont the other day and found a helmet out in front of the fort with a skull in it.  There was a hole right through iron, head, and all.  These are some queer sights up in front of that old fort and also in front of forts Vaux and Tavannes.  Except the Somme, it is the hardest-fought battlefield in France.  There were days when the Hun held parts of each fort and the French would be at hand-to-hand conflict with them all the time.  There were days when enough steel fell on them to fight the Civil War with. They show their wear and tear too.  It will take fifty years to make the surrounding country look as it did before the war. The French are gathering up all the duds and exploding them. You know it will be awful for the farmers in this neighborhood when they first go to plowing. There won't be any Croix de Guerre or Legion of Honor badges for the rubes who go skyward as result of plowshares hitting unexploded 77s and 150s.  For my part I don't believe I'd do any plowing if I had to do it here.  \n\nTomorrow is New Year's and we are going to celebrate it by a few boxing bouts and wrestling matches.  Maybe a basketball game or two if it isn't as muddy as usual and some races.  My Battery will be badly hurt if one of the boxing matches goes against us.  They have 7,000 francs bet on our man.  He's not Tommy Murphy either but another sergeant of mine named Meisburger.  Doesn't sound very Irish, does it?  I have some Schmidts and a Kuhn.  The Irish call 'em the German sympathizers and we always told 'em if we were captured they'd have to protect us.  Really they are among the best men I have, especially the Schmidts.

    "content": ",Lawton, Okla. Mar. 5, 1918\n\nDear Bess:\n\nYour letter came today and evidently my Sunday special did not arrive as a Sunday special. One of the barbers went to Oklahoma City and I gave it to him to mail. I hope he mailed it. We haven't gone yet on Monday evening although they say the cars to take us have arrived. There was a special order came out today saying that if the special detail were here the next muster period (April 1), they would be carried as if they were not a special detail. I don't much care whether we leave so soon or not because we are,getting some very good schooling. Had an examination yesterday in which we had a problem like this: a scout measured the angle found by two trees on the opposite bank of a river, it was 150 mils, he walked back fifty yards and the angle between the same two trees was 120 mils. How wide is the river? I got the right answer, what do you think of that? It is two hundred yards wide. A mil is the 1/6400 of a circle, which is the measurement we use instead of degrees. That was one of five we had to work besides several on drill regulations. We'll sure be wise birds when the war's over if we don't get,get shot first. I got an underground intimation that I passed my captain's examination all right. I don't believe it though until I see the evidence from Washington. I am telling you only because I thought maybe it would be nice to share good news with you if it is only a rumor, and I know you won't kid me about it if it's false. To tell you the honest truth I'd rather be a first lieutenant than anything else in the army except a buck private in the rear rank. He's the guy that has no responsibility and he's the guy that does the real work. I heard a good one the other day which said that a lieutenant knows nothing and does everything, a captain knows everything and does nothing, a major knows nothing and does nothing. Very true except that a captain has to know everything from sealing wax to sewing machines and has to run them. He also is responsible for about $750,000 worth of material and 193 men, their lives, their morals, their clothes, and their horses, which isn't much for $200 a month and pay your own expenses. I shall probably get the swell head just as all the captains do if I get it, and it will be lots better for me if I don't.\n\nYes Kenneth's story does \"sound well.\" I am sure he'd have been better thought of in the regiment if he'd gone (even by his Captain). I shouldn't say that but then its true he could have,gone if he'd wanted to. I think he just hated to leave Mary and miss an opportunity to go home for which I don't blame him. I think I'd almost give up going to get home once more.\n\nThis is Tuesday and I'm still here. I got as far as that last night and got called on a court martial case. I am a member of the general court, which doesn't mean anything only to hear evidence against some poor son of a gun who has used government funds for his,own use or done something against the 4 million regulations you're supposed to know and don't. I got done so late that I went right to bed because I was afraid I'd have to fire today and not be able to see to do it. Luckily I did not have to although Pete and Mr. Lee did. They did very well. I acted as an onlooker and fire observer. There were four batteries firing, and it was very hard to tell which was which. The weather has been so nearly ideal the last three days that I think the devil,or whoever else hands out Oklahoma weather has overlooked a bet. Don't you worry about my leaving because I'll certainly wire you when I start.\n\nPete is hollerin' for me and I've got to run.\n\nYours always, \nHarry,[postmark stamp: \"LAWTON MAR 5 6-PM 19 OKLA 18\"]\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             Miss Bess Wallace\n                                                                                 219 Deleware St.\n                                                                                  Independence     \n                                                                                                              Mo.,[postmark stamp: \"INDEPENDENCE [MO?] MAR 7 730AM 1918\"]"

    "content": "Camp La Baholle, near Verdun\nJanuary 3, 1919\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI intended writing you yesterday as I agreed to do, but things happened so quickly and the day went so fast I couldn't do it.  Had a basketball game in Verdun in the forenoon, in which I got defeated or my team did, rather, by a bunch of noncombatant engineers.  In the evening we pulled off a boxing bout in which my Sergeant Meisburger lost the decision over a gorilla named Hamby, and I lost 1,000 francs.  Of course being the loser I should say it was a rotten decision.  I won't say it, but the other fellow had to be carried from the ring and my man walked out—so you can judge for yourself what I think of the decision.  Also he's been going to the doctor every day since and my man was for duty the next morning.  As I told you before, I think more of that sergeant than if he were a boy of mine and I'd rather have been beaten by anyone on earth than one of Salisbury's outfit.  But as the French say, \"It is the war,\" and somebody had to lose.  I've paid fifteen dollars to see a fight that wasn't worth half as much as that one was though.  It was a fight from start to finish and was really a show.  \n\nOh! Loads of joy, my Christmas box came this evening.  I started this letter yesterday and had to leave before I got it finished.  This pen is a humdinger—writes better than any I ever owned, and those handkerchiefs are certainly the most beautiful I ever ordered.  They are certainly grand and I shall use them when I go on state affairs, such as a dinner with the colonel or a trip to Paris, if ever I get another.  I'll also save one of 'em to wear to my wedding—which shall it be?  I can't decide which is the best looking.  \n\nYou've no idea what a lot of comfort getting that box was.  It was exactly like a small piece of God's country arriving in this forsaken place.  Even if it was late, it made no difference because all the days are nearly alike and we can make any one of them Christmas.\n\nI just had a horrible rumor imparted to me today--that we go to Germany.  There were so many F&I's (full and immediate separation) in the Brigade that all of us have to stick so they say.  The Colonel has turned us in as a regiment of farmers from Western Missouri hoping that they'll send us home in time to put in our spring crops.  I hope it works.  Can't you notice an improvement in my penmanship since I started in with this new pen?  I wouldn't take $40.00 for it.  \n\nGoing back to that fight Battery D lost about 8000 francs on it and we had a Y.M.C.A. show here last evening and one of the girls pulled a joke about D Bty's Hack Drivers all being broken but the Ladies of Good Old K.C. were sending a bushel of francs to help us out.  They did too send me 3112 francs.  A bunch of the sisters of D Bty sold a quilt for $570.00.  It was a sorely needed donation too.  I tell you after paying 1281 francs for a hog and dispensing all those francs on that fight.  Am I immoral to induce my battery to bet on a prize fight?  The Chaplain says not.  Says if he'd been here he'd have bet on my sergeant.\n\n\nI am enclosing you some pictures taken on my leave and one especially interesting one of a shell bursting in Verdun.  I have seen several burst there but I didn't see this particular one.  It is a very good picture.\n\nI hope I can write you a better letter next time.

Of course the letter is a joy forever, but a letter and a Hershey - well its worth two praise be's and several thank you's. We can't obtain Hersheys over here and in my opinion there's hardly any chocoloate that equals it for flavor and satisfaction. We get a brand over here that's made by an old party named Menier.

But don't put too much faith in that date because such festivals are movable and not fixed. If we shouldn't succeed in getting our men altered to fit their service records it may require an unreeling of pink tape to such an extent that we'll be delayed thirty days. What's a mere 30 days to G. H. Q. (which some say means get home quick - I doubt it myself)? There's also a new General Order out to the effect that all battery and company commanders whose funds are messed up will be detached from their organizations and held in France until a proper balance is struck. Now they may reach out and yank me off the gang plank just as I'm getting aboard in order to have me untangle my money from the company's but if they do I'll be much richer by some hundred of francs. You know a battery commander has as many duties and as much prying around to do as the chairwoman of a Ladies Aid; besides having to write to various wives, widows, mothers, sisters, cousins, aunts and paw in laws as to the general health and financial condition of Privates James William O'Grady, King and O'Toole, you've got to keep 'em clothed and fed. If they lose their clothes or trade 'em for Vin Rouge and don't make 'em pay for the loss the B. C.'s stuck. If your reserve ration goes up in Willie Stew by a careless mess sergeant the B C pays. If the battery fund gets tangled the B. C. pays etc etc ad lib. One bird I have refused to write to his mother because Uncle Sam fined him $60.00 for going A W O L to see her and I got a letter from the Commanding General of the Second Army wanting to know why I didn't make him write her. Well he did all right, all right but he wound up his epistle by saying he was only doing it because the Captain would put him in the jug if he didn't, and I let it go because it was true.\n\nThey aren't all like that though. I have an overwhelming majority I wouldn't trade for a million dollars. They have real Irish hearts and they love their mother and sweetheart just that way. Some letters to mothers I've censored are masterpieces and I know they are meant because I know the men.\n\nI don't think there's any of 'em thought who are as deeply in love as their own Captain to whom they bring their troubles and I guess that's why he can sympathise with 'em.\n\nPlease write as often as you can to one who loves you madly.\n\nAlways yours\nHarry.\n\nHarry S.

What's a mere 30 days to G. H. Q. (which some say means get home quick - I doubt it myself)? There's also a new General Order out to the effect that all battery and company commanders whose funds are messed up will be detached from their organizations and held in France until a proper balance is struck. Now they may reach out and yank me off the gang plank just as I'm getting aboard in order to have me untangle my money from the company's but if they do I'll be much richer by some hundred of francs. You know a battery commander has as many duties and as much prying around to do as the chairwoman of a Ladies Aid; besides having to write to various wives, widows, mothers, sisters, cousins, aunts and paw in laws as to the general health and financial condition of Privates James William O'Grady, King and O'Toole, you've got to keep 'em clothed and fed. If they lose their clothes or trade 'em for,Vin Rouge and don't make 'em pay for the loss the B. C.'s stuck. If your reserve ration goes up in Willie Stew by a careless mess sergeant the B C pays. If the battery fund gets tangled the B. C. pays etc etc ad lib. One bird I have refused to write to his mother because Uncle Sam fined him $60.00 for going A W O L to see her and I got a letter from the Commanding General of the Second Army wanting to know why I didn't make him write her. Well he did all right, all right but he wound up his epistle by saying he was only doing it because the Captain would put him in the jug if he didn't, and I let it go because it was true.\n\nThey aren't all like that though. I have an overwhelming majority I wouldn't trade for a million dollars. They have,real Irish hearts and they love their mother and sweetheart just that way. Some letters to mothers I've censored are masterpieces and I know they are meant because I know the men.\n\nI don't think there's any of 'em thought who are as deeply in love as their own Captain to whom they bring their troubles and I guess that's why he can sympathise with 'em.\n\nPlease write as often as you can to one who loves you madly.\n\nAlways yours\nHarry.\n\nHarry S. Truman\nCaptain 129 FA\nAmerican E. F."

    "content": ",Dearest Bess:\n\nYesterday was a grand day because three letters came from you. I received two from Mary and one from Boxlet also. The sun shown [shone] out for all of an hour, we had a holiday and our own private field meet so that taking it all in all it was a right successful occasion.\n\nI told you before that we are slated for an early return to God's country and I expect movement orders at an hour so we are very happy. It will be along in April however before New York harbor sees us dock. I also told you that I have that won[?] cross for Uncle Strother but I'm going to carry it with me because the mail seems to be rather uncertain.\n\nThe reason our letters are stamped with a post mark long after the date written on the date line is because the mail is collected by regiments and,sent to an A.P.O. and then stamped. Sometimes it takes several days to arrive at the A.P.O. hence the difference in date lines.\n\nI have been real good today. Went to Bar le Duc and went to Mass. I have a Catholic Lieutenant, Ducourueu [sp?] by name (Ducano he calls it) who is from Lousiiana and who is responsible for my attending mass. He's not very orthodox and neither am I, as you very well know but we were curious to see inside one of the old churches and also expected to hear some good music. Our curiosity was satisfied and we were not disappointed in the music. There was a grand organ and a master at the keyboard. He played a most beautiful offertory from Bach and some woman with a grand soprano voice sang a part of the Mass. The church has some very find paintings and some stained glass windows behind the altar that are very beautiful. There are four of them and each one had a Boch[?] bullethole punched in it. Evidently made by shelf fragments. Bar le Duc was under fire in the first,battle of the Marne and was bombed once a week or oftener during the whole war. I don't suppose that those windows will be mended ever because some old heathen will want to collect francs from American tourists while he unwinds some magnificent lie about how they came to be busted.\n\nThey have beautiful costumes for the priests and choir boys. One old priest who took up the collection had on a lace skirt that most any American woman would trade her husband for. There was one individual whose duties and position I couldn't quite fathom. He had on a Napoleon Bonapart hat with a white plume running from end to end of it. His uniform would make a Greek general jealous and he had on a rapier or sword I couldn't tell which. In his right hand he carried a tall cane with a golden ball,on top of it like you see in pictures of Louis XIV and Madam de Maubou[sp?]. He was in the back of the Church when we went in standing like the guardian of the gates of Heaven but when the collection priest started to pass the hat he marched up the aisle and placed himself in front of the collector and marched ahead of him. He'd go about four steps and set his cane down with a bang and then wait while the priest made a good canvass of about ten rows of seats and then he'd move the same distance again. Now I can't figure if he was a representative of the French government to see that the State gets a fair share of the contribution or if he was some part of the Catholic Church machinery. I was afraid to ask for fear it might be an unnecessary inquiry. Anyway as Mark would say he impressed me very much and I looked at him as much as I did the whole row of priests and choiristers [?] and censor boys it took to put on High Mass. One little old kid was sure an expert at swinging the incense pat. If the,main priest had ever backed up while that pot was working he'd hae been brained sure[?].\n\nI had a lot of fun in my office this evening. Got an order that I cou[ld] let some of very best men go to Paris I made out a list of ten or twelve and sent an orderly out after them. I didn't tell him what I wanted with them and when each one would come in and report \"Sir Sgt or Corp or Prt So + So reports to the Captain as ordered\" and stand there expecting a good wigging for something and I would look at them severely and say \"Do you want to go to Paris?\" Well you could just see him collapse. Some of them looked at me foolishly and said \"Do I what sir?\" and every one of 'em nearly had a fit when he found he could really go. The first ones in enjoyed the discomfort[ing?] of the rest very much. I hardly ever send,for one of 'em unless he's been into something he's no business and every one of the whole lot expected a calling down. I am expecting another trip to Paris myself and I hope I can make it.\n\nThe \"Hon\" Henry J. Allen seems to be making it rather unpleasant for our artillery in our home town. It looks also as if the darned old Star was trying to help him discredit us. It's rather peculiar that a peanut politician could see in two hours what some of us who were in that drive six days failed to see. He was up behind the lives about 5 kilos on the afternoon of the second day of the drive handing out cigars and chocolate to the Kansas boys and telling them that he'd been made General of Kansas. Salisbury succeeded in getting some chocolate for E Bty by putting it out that most of his men were from kansas. The Hon Henry J you know is no military man, he lived mostly in Paris and Bar le Duc whlie he was over here, he was up near the front on one day of the drive for a short time and now he tells everyone that we were no good,that we shot our own infantry and a lot of other tosh and poppycock. He says he saw 6000 wounded in a dressing station. What he saw was an evacuation hospital seven miles back. Our Division Surgeon Major Gist was in the front lives all the time had dressing stations going at every place one could he put and worked under fire himself the whole time. Our artillery was in the fight from start to finish, was mentioned in orders for its excellent work both by our own Major General and by the Major General commanding the First Division whom we supported two days after the 35th was relieved. The General of the 1st Division is an Artillery man and he wouldn't have cited us if we hadn't deserved it. I have also in my files an order from the Commanding General of the 81st Division commending the 60th F.a. Brigade,for its excellent work in the Conflans [?] Offensive which was going on at [town name?] when the war stopped.\n\nI personally know that the infantry had artillery support from beginning to end because I was in the front live infantry myself and directed the fire of my battery both on the afternoon of the second day and the morning of the third. Their Batteries A B + C and the 128th regiment in full moved up to 500 meters behind the front and did a lot of point blank firing.\n\nSome people seem to think that artillery can just pulverize the enemy and then the infantry just parades up and nobody gets hurt sort of pink tea affair like Home Guards put on out on Gillaw[?] Road. Well it's not done that way. The Artillery busts 'em open with a rolling barrage to start and then the infantry goes out and smears what's left over the landscape and if our infantry can shoot faster and there's more of 'em than the other fellow why we win if not we come back, what's left and,start over. Somebody's bound to get killed or badly mussed up anyway. After the infantry goes forward then the artillery moves up as fast as it can and shoots at whatever it can to help out the situation. We did just that and while we were short of horses we got there just the same. I hitched my men on with the horses and helped my guns across the mud of no mans land. It took us [?] to go one kilometer but no one could have moved faster under the circumstances. Anyway Gen Pershing told us we covered ourselves with glory and three Major Generals have told us in orders that we are efficient and good shots so what's the opinion of a peanut politician. Except that he can dishonor us in our home town after we've done our damndest. I hope he chokes and the Star along with him.,If some of my Irish get to him they'll make his ambitions look like a grease spot. He was only over here for political reasons and he never even had the Artillery on his Y.M.C.A. lists. They tell it on him that if you were from Kansas you stood ace high but no note no chocolate. We never did get anything from him while he ran our Division Y. It makes no difference only we'd like to come home having the Rome folks thinking we did our job well and thoroughly.\n\nRemember me to your mother and all the family and keep writing to one who loves you.\n\nAlways,\nHarry\n\nHarry S Truman\nCapt 129 Fa\nAmerican E.F.,Miss Bess Wallace\n219 Delaware St\nIndependence Mo\nU.S.A.\n\nLTRS DATED 2/23 and 2/25/19"

The mail orderly doesn't know whether he got it or not and I can't find it.  I had just gotten some letters from you and naturally told you how glad I was.  Also I told you that we are coming home right away.  I know it officially now because General Pershing shook hands with me--and told me so.  I also met the Prince of Wales, as did every other company and battery commander in the 35th Division.  \n\nWe were inspected by Gen Pershing, the Prince of Wales and a whole troop of Generals, Colonels and Majors.  Have been getting ready for the event since Friday.  The General told me I had a nice looking bunch of men and that he wanted me to take them home as clean morally and physically as when they came over so that the home people could be as proud of them as he is.  He gave us a little talk after we'd passed in review and told us we'd covered ourselves with glory in the Meuse Argonne drive and that no carping politician could take that satisfaction away from us.  Also he said America won the war and that there was no argument to that.  That the 35th was an immense cog in the wheel and he was proud of us because we came from his part of the country.  I am mighty glad I belong to that Division.  It seems that we cracked the hardest nut on the line.  It is a saying that the 35th had more nerve and less brains than any that ever went over the top.  I guess it's so.\n\nMaybe you think it wasn't a job to get a battery ready for that inspection.  Every helmet had to be painted and stenciled on each side with a Santa Fe cross in red and yellow, every overcoat had to be cleaned and have that same cross sewed on the sleeve.  Then packs had to be made exactly alike.  We had to take 131 men and of course about 129 of 'em can do things exactly as you tell 'em, but the other two can spoil the whole show.  \n\nI had to eliminate and have about six inspections before I could get everyone ready.  We made it though and my battery got to stand in front of the whole regiment. I don't know if it was luck or if they looked the best.  They looked pretty fine if I do say it as I shouldn't.  The regiment was lined up in column of Batteries D, E, F, A, B, C, Hqrs and Supply Co.  So I was right out in front.  We went over in trucks and of course one of 'em got smashed and part of the men had to walk some distance and the same thing coming back but no one was hurt in any way.  I was in charge of the Battalion going over and coming back.  The new Colonel gave me a good calling down because I gave Colonel Elliott a public sassing and I guess I deserved it but so did Elliott.  The new Colonel is a Regular and he can't see this N.G. lack of cringing when a Colonel or a Lt. Col. comes around.  I have an awful bad habit of using a very sharp tongue when one of 'em says something he has no business to me.  It doesn't work in play soldiering.  You have to say Yes Sir and No Sir and Alright Sir even when you should punch his head.  Hence my urgent desire to get back to the farm.  There's one or two whom I want to meet when I get on my overalls and they'd better have on their armour.\n\nOf course when the next real fight comes the civilians will come forward just as they did this time and win it in spite of the Regular Army.  I have some five statistics for home consumption just as soon as I get out.\n\nI have an Iron Cross for Uncle Strother with a ribbon on it.  It came from Coblenty and is a dandy.  One of my men got it from a fellow on leave from up there who purchased it from the owner.  That of course is not as romantic as to pick it up off the Battlefield of Verdun but all those up there were simply wrecked and the ribbons rotten.  This one is as good as new.  I guess I'll have to saddle soap it a little to make it look as if it had been worn in battle.\n\nAnother thing.  Please get ready to march down the aisle with me just as soon as you decently can when I get back.  I haven't any place to go but home and I'm busted financially but I love you as madly as a man can and I'll find all the other things.  We'll be married anywhere you say at any time you mention and if you want only one person or the whole town I don't care as long as you make it quickly after my arrival.  I have some army friends I'd like to ask and my own family and that's all I care about, and the army friends can go hang if you don't want 'em.

It took a right good conversation and some maneuvering to land me here but I got to come and bring three of my sergeants along with me. All the officers who came over first have trunks at the American Express Company. Someone had to come and get them. I succeeded in getting my Battery Fund and my personal account balled up so that a Philadelphia lawyer couldn't tell which is my money and which is the Battery's. You know French bookkeeping is a deep dark mystery and they had credited me with battery money and the battery with mine, charged my checks to the battery and the battery's to me, and had done it without favor to either side, but it fixed the accounts so you could not tell head or tail. I had to come up here and draw the whole of both accounts and put my money in one pocket and the battery's in another. When the baggage trip came up why my having an account to fix and trunks also got me the job. I asked for help and they gave me three sergeants. Naturally I brought three of my own. I let 'em draw for it and just to show you my battery's not entirely Irish Tierney, Cheney and Seiben won!\n\nI hired a taxi and took 'em sightseeing today. I'm afraid they were more interested in the girls than the sights but they pretended to be very much impressed with Notre Dame and Napoleons tomb. We also went to see the Pantheon de la Guerre which is a grand painting of the war. Its about forty feet high and is painted around the inside of a circular building about 100 feet in diameter. I'd judge the picture to be 300 feet long if it was stretched out. The background shows all the battlefields of France beginning at the Belgian coast and running to the Vosges. In the foreground are life sized pictures of the heros, presidents, generals etc. A section is devoted to each country. Ours of course has Woodrow, Josephus Newton Daniels, Gen. Pershing along with the various Admirals and generals we've had on the fighting line. The British shows George V and the sweet little Pricipe [sic] de Gales along with Admiral Beattie Marshal Haig and other British lights and lesser lights. It takes a set of steps to show all the French while only a narrow margin is devoted to Japan and Portugal. People will come from the ends of the earth to see it when traffic in tourists is resumed. France has to do something to get American money after we're gone. I'm for the French anyway. They fought bled and died more than all the rest of the world (except poor old Russia) and if they want to bleed a little money out of us I'm for 'em. If you could see Verdun and Chemin des Dames where more Frenchmen were killed than we ever had men on the front you'd sure be glad to help 'em any way you can. They do say that the Germans are treating our men so well that the whole Army of Occupation will go home German sympathizers. It's a peculiar human trait I guess to forget Belgium and ruined and devastated France, forget the Lusitania and the ruthless cruelty of the Huns and remember only that they gave us feather beds when we went among them as conquerors and the French gave us barns although the we came to help them. The French gave their own soldiers barns too. We'll remember that the French raised prices on us yet our own patriotic citizens did us the same way at Lawton and in New York. For my part I hope the great things of France will be remembered and the small ones forgotten, that the awful cruelties and atrocious treatment of Belgium and northern France will be remembered and the pie and feather beds forgotten in Germany's case.\n\nWell Paris is Paris and a great place to be if you were only here too. But I wouldn't give a certain Jackson County Missouri farm I know of for the whole _____ town, with the rest of France thrown in for good measure. I saw the hats of the Archbishops of Paris who were beheaded in the Revolution today also a lot of the personal equipment of the Great Napoleon. His tomb is all clear of sandbags now and is the most beautiful place of the kind I ever saw. A man had to raise a lot of sand in the world to get planted as handsomely as he is. You can't imagine what a beautiful place it is. The sarcophagus itself is of red granite or some kind of red stone polished till a fly can't stand on it. It stands in a circle beneath a great golden dome. There are statues of Victory and all the other Goddesses holding out wreaths to the dead Emperor. The building itself is as large as a church and is of the finest Corinthian architecture. Jerome Napoleon and Joseph are also buried there. So are Marshal Turenne and Vauban. There are two empty rooms which I guess are being saved for Marshals Joffre and Foch. All Napoleons captured flags are around his tomb and there are a great many of them.\n\nI had my photograph by one the sergeants in front of the Arc de Triumphe and also on the Pont Alexandre III which is the finest bridge across the Seine. \n\nWe are going to sail about April 15th nothing interfering and I hope most sincerely that nothing does. I should see you about May 8th or thereabouts.\n\nCapt. Pete Allen has been sent to the 4th Division and my good Lt Jordon to the 1st. They are going to stay in the army. I don't know how Pete will square himself with Hanna when she finds he's not coming [sic] home for another year. He did the proper thing though because he's got the best job he ever had and he has ability and inclination in that direction.\n\nI guess Klemm and Elliott are home by now, God bless 'em.

The building itself is as large as a church and is of the finest Corinthian architecture. Jerome Napoleon and Joseph are also buried there. So are Marshal Turenne and Vauban.

An order has been put forth canceling all leaves and furloughs and setting a date for us to turn in our guns, horses, etc. and start for Le Mans, which is a clearing place for home.  I am not putting too much faith in things because there are many slips between the promulgation of order and their fulfillment.  It is as easy for the Commanding General to change his order as it is for me to give a man extra duty.  Therefore when we arrive at that coast wise port I'll know we may start for home.\n\nYou've no idea how I'll hate to give up my guns, my French 75s, those implements of destruction which the Hun has said were weapons of the devil.  You know I told you in a letter from Coetquidan that if I could only give the command that fired one volley at the Hun I would go home willingly and be satisfied.  Well there were some ten thousand rounds—or if fired in volleys, over two thousand volleys—fired by those guns at Heinie and they did it all at my command.  They are the same guns that I learned to shoot with and with the exception of one barrel, which I had to leave in the Argonne with a shell lodged in it, there have been no repairs on them.  If the government would let me have one of them, I'd pay for it and pay the transportation home just to let it sit in my front yard and rust.  Men you know—gunners and section chiefs especially—become very much attached to their guns.  They name 'em Katie, Lizzie, Liberty, Diana, and other fantastic and high-sounding names and when they fire them they talk to them as if they were people.  French gunners even cry when their guns are taken away from them.  Guns do have individuality.  No two of them shoot alike and weather conditions will affect each of them differently.  Two of mine would shoot short of the range table, one over and one almost exactly.  \n\nEach of my section chiefs was morally certain that his gun would out shoot the other three and they were all jealous of the one who adjusted for me when I'd begin to shoot so I always gave them turn about.  I was very lucky in the Argonne to get to observe my fire and to adjust on three very interesting targets--at any rate it was interesting to me but I have an idea that the poor boobs at the other end of the trajectory were not so interested except in getting out of the way.  I put 43 shells on a German battery going down a road in less than a minute.  It caused quite a scuttering out and that road was not used any more that day.  One time up in front of Verdun I was lucky enough to adjust the whole battery and hit the target (a corner of a trench) with ten shots.  It is the greatest sport in the world, shooting 75's is.  You're never right certain when you start to shoot whether your shots are going to be near the target in your own trenches or in the next county.  At target practice once I fired six shots with one gun and as far as I could discover that six never did come down, but when I fired the next shot for the General it lit right where it should.   \n\nI don't suppose I'll ever fire another shot with a 75 gun and know I won't with these I'm so attached to and it makes me rather sad.  It's like parting with old friends who've stood by me through thick and thin and now I have to give 'em to some ordnance chap to put away and maybe later some fop out of West Point will use 'em for target practice and declare they're no good because he don't know how to shoot 'em.  \n\nI went riding with Major Gates today.  We tried to find the Chapel of Ste. Genevieve over in the woods about 5 kilometers from here but missed it.  It was the meeting place for the  hunts given by the Counts of Bar [illegible] to their neighbors the Dukes of Lorraine, Burgundy, and [illegible] in ancient times.  We found a church over in a neighboring village that was built some 500 years ago which isn't so old as things go here in France.  There is a chateau in Bar le Duc that belonged to the ancient Dukes of Lorraine.  It is a very beautiful place and escaped the bombs and shell that some of the rest of the town caught.  \n\nI've got a lot of Kodak pictures of Verdun and my last battery positions which I am going to send to you as soon as I get them printed.

I am so glad you had a happy white Christmas.  It is a good omen I'm sure and I sincerely hope that the \"flu\" will be an unheard of ailment from this time forward.\n\nYour point is well taken regarding the furniture in my room at the Hotel Mediterranee (can't spell it).  It would of course be essential to provide either a place to eat or a range.  I am very sure that I shouldn't have overlooked a vital point like that even if I am blinded by Eros.  My experiences to date have taught me most emphatically that it is very very essential that food be provided in plentiful quantities even if clothing has to be overlooked sometimes.  Some of my men have been pretty close to nature at various times as to clothes but if there happened to be plenty of roast beef and baked beans it was a happy bunch.  But leave off the eats for a meal or two and it made one \"h---\" of a mean war\" to put it as they do.  Therefore I won't overlook that end of it nor any other I hope.  The stationary George and May gave you is simply grand and it makes me sorry to have to answer it on this kind but even this hand is at a high premium here.  I think Mary's picture is pretty fine myself.   \n\nYou know I have two breast pockets in my blouse.  Naturally you can guess whose picture stays in the left-hand one.  I keep Mary's and Mamma's in the other.  Yours is the one you sent me at Doniphan and it has never left me from that day to this, nor will it ever.  It's been through all the trials and tribulations and happy moments same as I have.  I have looked at it many, many times and imagined that you were there in spirit, as I knew you were, and it's helped a lot—especially when things were blue and it would look as if I'd surely blow up if another thing went wrong.  I've never blown up and my disposition isn't so very bad.  That picture saved it.  The biggest worry I've ever had was when I heard that the original of that picture had the flu and the happiest day was when that letter came saying you'd walked uptown.  I am hoping that Nice will not be an impossibility to us and I don't believe it will.  You did right to send your proxy to Boxley.  He's to be trusted absolutely.\n\nWe are having another spasm of moving.  There have been orders out twice to move up back to a dirty, little old French village but each time Gen. Berry has been able to get them canceled because we have better quarters here than we can possibly get in a town.  I suppose though that we'll go this time.  I heard a real good rumor the other day.  To show you how they start I'll just trace this one for you.  An ordanance sergeant (get that ordANance) who was overhauling F.Bty's guns told the Lt who went after them that his own commanding officer, a Lt. had been told by the Generals aide that our guns were being overhauled so that they could be turned in at LeMans on Jan 27 which happens to be the Kaiser's birthday (so he said) and then we'd all go home.  Now the whole foundation for that nice tale was the definite order for us to move back to a little old village and be billeted not far from Bar-le-Duc and about 40 miles from here.  \nIt's my opinion that we'll stay there until Woodie gets his pet peace plans refused or okayed.  For my part, and every A.E.F. man feels the same way, I don't give a whoop (to put it mildly) whether there's a League of Nations or whether Russia has a Red government or a Purple one, and if the President of the Czecho-Slovaks wants to pry the throne from under the King of Bohemia, let him pry but send us home.  We came over here to help whip the Hun.  We helped a little, the Hun yowled for peace, and he's getting it in large doses and if our most excellent ex-mayor of Cleveland wants to make a hit with us, he'll hire or buy some ships and put the Atlantic Ocean between us and the Vin Rouge Sea.  For my part I've had enough vin rouge and frogeater victuals to last me a lifetime.  And anyway it looks to me like the moonshine business is going to be pretty good in the land of Liberty loans and green trading stamps, and some of us want to get in on the ground floor.  At least we want to get there in time to lay in a supply for future consumption.  I think a quart of bourbon would last me about forty years.  \n\nI hope you have a most happy birthday and that you never see another one without me to help celebrate and then may they go on without end.  Remember me to your mother and Fred and Frank and Natalie and George and May and just keep writing when you feel inclined, because I love you.  \n\nAlways,\nHarry\n\nAM. EX.

I have looked at it many, many times and imagined that you were there in spirit, as I knew you were, and it's helped a lot—especially when things were blue and it would look as if I'd surely blow up if another thing went wrong.  I've never blown up and my disposition isn't so very bad.  That picture saved it.  The biggest worry I've ever had was when I heard that the original of that picture had the flu and the happiest day was when that letter came saying you'd walked up,town.  I am hoping that Nice will not be an impossibility to us and I don't believe it will.  You did right to send your proxy to Boxley.  He's to be trusted absolutely.\n\nWe are having another spasm of moving.  There have been orders out twice to move up back to a dirty, little old French village but each time Gen. Berry has been able to get them canceled because we have better quarters here than we can possibly get in a town.  I suppose though that we'll go this time.  I heard a real good rumor the other day.  To show you how they start I'll just trace this one for you.  An ordanance sergeant (get that ordANance) who was overhauling F.Bty's guns told the Lt who went after them that his own commanding officer, a Lt. had been told by the Generals aide that our guns were being overhauled so that they could be turned in at LeMans on,Jan 27 which happens to be the Kaiser's birthday (so he said) and then we'd all go home.  Now the whole foundation for that nice tale was the definite order for us to move back to a little old village and be billeted not far from Bar-le-Duc and about 40 miles from here.  \nIt's my opinion that we'll stay there until Woodie gets his pet peace plans refused or okayed.  For my part, and every A.E.F. man feels the same way, I don't give a whoop (to put it mildly) whether there's a League of Nations or whether Russia has a Red government or a Purple one, and if the President of the Czecho-Slovaks wants to pry the throne from under the King of Bohemia, let him pry but send us home.  We came over here to help whip the Hun.  We helped a little, the Hun yowled for peace, and he's getting it in large doses and if our most excellent ex-mayor of Cleveland wants to make a hit with us, he'll hire or buy some ships and put the Atlantic Ocean between us and the Vin Rouge Sea.  For my part I've had enough vin rouge and frogeater victuals to last me a lifetime.  And anyway it looks to me like the moonshine business is going to be pretty good in the land of Liberty loans and green trading stamps, and some of us want to get in on,the ground floor.  At least we want to get there in time to lay in a supply for future consumption.  I think a quart of bourbon would last me about forty years.  \n\nI hope you have a most happy birthday and that you never see another one without me to help celebrate and then may they go on without end.  Remember me to your mother and Fred and Frank and Natalie and George and May and just keep writing when you feel inclined, because I love you.  \n\nAlways,\nHarry,AM. EX.

I am certainly glad to hear that you are up and almost well.  You know I am pulling for you to be entirely well as quickly as possible.  I don't know when I've been so worried as when I heard that you and Mary both had the flu, and I've never felt so fine as when I heard you were both getting well.\n\nYou asked me if you can address a letter to me at this place.  No it can't be done because we may move any time to some little old town in the back areas and then the letter would never find me.  If it is addressed to 129 FA American E.F. it will always catch up even if it is a little slow sometimes.\n\nYou spoke of C.C. Bunschu's having a letter published saying that we'd be home soon.  C.C. will I guess because he was detached from the regiment and sent to the S.O.S. a few days after the regiment was pulled out of the lines.  I always thought him a very efficient officer but the powers that be especially one second in command never did like C.C. and that principally was  the reason he was sent back.  The last I heard of him he was at Bordeaux awaiting transportation home.\n\nPlease let me beg of you not to say anything about my letter of commendation.  I only told it because I thought I was very lucky and that you'd like to know it.  You know the most embarrassing thing that can happen to a fellow over here is to have his enthusiastic friends or relatives publish his private correspondence or hold him up as someone who deserves especial credit.  There's not one of us who have done anything that any other one of us could not and would not have done if the opportunity had offered.  Most real citations—and citations can only be made by generals in general orders—are a terrible embarrassment to the men they affect.  There were three of our lieutenants cited and they are having an awful time living it down.  Webster's letters of commendation is causing him no end of kidding just because his folks don't know what a citation is and what it means.  General Traub made the fact that I happened to have the best chief mechanic in the artillery brigade a subject for a general memorandum and he wrote me a formal letter of commendation on the condition of my materiel.  His statement was that it \"showed especial efficiency in the commissioned and enlisted personnel of the organization.\"  Well the enlisted personnel did the work and should have the credit.  I sent the letter to Boxley, and if you care to see it he will show it to you.  However I don't want it published because it can cause me to be court-martialed for stealing it out of the files of the organization, and would cause me no end of embarrassment.  My chief mechanic happened to be a whirlwind and I happened to be lucky, and that's all there is to it.  \n\nI have never seen Mary Paxton and I guess I'll be very lucky if I do. I would certainly like to see her. You know we can't go anywhere but to old ruined Verdun or out to Douaumont or some other skeleton surrounded place nearby and I don't suppose I shall see her unless she get assigned to the Verdun area.\n\nFred is mistaken about your having to get information about me from Miss Maggie. I have written her exactly four letters since I've been in France. I had no idea she would consider that they were worth any comment as I simply told her as I have you of some of the sad and funny things I've seen and heard about and told her of one of our night \"Marches.\"\n\nMy long letter to you covered my tracks and experiences pretty well but I'm afraid if must have been an awful bore. I don't intend to talk about the war much when I get home if I can help it because the boys back in the S.O.S. can tell better stories than anything that really happened to us who were lucky enough to see any of the real thing and I think it will be better to let them do the talking - besides I've already told you everything that's happened to me from start to finish and you certainly won't want to be bothered with it again. I saw a piece in the \"Herald\" saying that some Congressman from Mass. Had skinned the armchair brigade alive because they had not been fair to Nat'l Guard officers. I'm going to vote from him for President when I get home. Enough said\n\nI do wish I could see you but I'm about of the opinion that summer will be well on its way when I do.

A mail brought me three letters from you dated December 13, 16, 18, one from Fred, two from Mary, and one from Miss Maggie.  I am so glad you are out of danger from that awful flu.  You've no idea how uneasy I've been since hearing you and Mary had it.  We over here can realize somewhat how you must have felt when we were under fire a little.  Every day nearly someone of my outfit will hear that his mother, sister, or sweetheart is dead.  It is heartbreaking almost to think that we are so safe and so well over here and that the ones we'd like to protect more than all the world have been more exposed to death than we.  I am hoping that the worst is past and that from now on we'll never hear of it again.  It seems that war and pestilence go hand in hand.  If it isn't the Black Death it is something equally as fatal.  We hear that the poor Russians are dying by hundreds and the damnable Hun is murdering himself for pleasure.  I suppose it will be some time before we have a golden age of health, peace, and prosperity such as the ten years before 1914 were.  \n\nYou certainly do get plenty of conflicting rumors.  When we first came up to the Verdun sector about October 17 the whole 35th held the front for which we were the Artillery support.  On Nov. 8 the infantry of the 35th were relieved by the \"Wild Cats\" or 81st Division.  The \"Cats\" had no Artillery and we were attached to them and when an advance was ordered here on the 9th our artillery went forward in support of the 'Cat\" infantry.  We were attached to the 81st for about ten days and then returned to the 35th although we have never moved more than 5 miles in that whole time.  My brothers never went forward on the last drive but sat still and fired right where we were.  The \"Cats\" never did get beyond the range of my gun.  \"C\" \"E\" and \"F\" went forward about 4 kilometers but moved back to their old positions on the 12th.  On the 17th we moved our guns back to our horse lines and we've been here ever since.  I'd just about as soon have gone to Germany as to sit here as we have.  We don't know now what we're going to do but we hope we are going home some time soon.  You need not be uneasy about my reenlisting or staying in the army if I can get out.  Of course if the emergency still exists I'll be perfectly willing to go in again and do my best but it doesn't (and I think it doesn't), I want to go home and quickly.  I have dependents you know and I hope to take on another right away so they can't hold me on that account.\n\nMorgan tells me that I have an excellent chance of falling into something real good when I return.

    "content": "Le Mans, France\nMarch 15, 1919 [misdated 1918]\n\nDearest Bess:\n\nAt last we are really and truly headed for home. I am ashamed to admit that I haven't written to you for fifteen days but if you are interested in a recital of events since March 6 I'll tell you whats happened and then I hope you'll forgive me. I had two letters from you yesterday and one the day before. It certainly is pleasing to hear you say you are able to be on hand for breakfast, can go to Kansas City and do things as you always have. I've been more worried than you can imagine since you've been sick but I hope the sight of you will cure all my worries forever and if there is no slip, that shouldn't be a far distant event. It seems almost impossible that we're really headed for home and will probably sail before the middle of April. The Divisions ahead of us are moving before their schedule.\n\nWell to go back to Rosieres - we got the order to entrain on the sixth at Trionville-Narcios some sixteen kilometers from where we were billeted which is the usual arrangement in affairs military. Bar-le-Duc was only six kilometers but for the convenience of some regiments that were more distant we walked sixteen. The 110th ammunition train of which Major Thacher is now a part swiped our trucks and my battery had to walk all the way and carry a full pack half the way. We marched half the distance on the evening of the 5th and stayed all night with Battery B. Got up at 4:45 A.M. and went the balance of the way the next morning in the rain under full pack. Our train consisted of 46 freight cars, French make and two German second and third class passenger coaches for five batteries and the officers. You know all French freight cars are marked Cheveaux 8 Hommes 40 which means that when men are loaded they must be pretty well squeezed in. There were about 30 to the car. Lt. Col. Gates was in command of the train. (He's been promoted since I last wrote you.) We had a long tiresome ride of two days and nights and were finally unloaded twenty kilometers from our billets although the railroad ran within six of the place where were going. Trucks were supposed to meet us be were late in coming and we started out in full pack on that twenty kilo hike. When the trucks did meet us about 3 kilos from our destination my outfit just kept on marching and whistling and carried their packs the whole way. You can't beat the Irish. If you desert them for the Gorillas when we arrive home I shall certainly be heartbroken because they're not to be mentioned in the same breath. Of course I don't want you to desert the home folks but I hope you will let Battery D have a small part of your attention anyway.\n\nWe are billeted at a large Chateau about fifteen miles from Le Mans. There are five batteries in the place and it is sure crowded. Bat D. drew the top floor. We have to go up and down 88 steps to get to our quarters. It was certainly a dirty place when the Batteries arrived as places usually are when we arrive. But we will leave it clean. The colonel came overland in an automobile. He came out to look things over and gave us particular dickens because things weren't clean. As most squirrel head Regular Army Officers he can give you hell for things not done but offers no remedy. You may be sure we are going to be strong for the regulars when we get back. If I can help make 'em work the rest of their lives with a pick and shovel I'm going to do it. I am told that 88% of the Regular Army officers were in the S. O. S. 4% in USA and 4% on the fighting front. Fifteen of them were killed. (I don't know how that happened but I reckon there were no reservists or N. G. officers handy to send out in their places. The reason that such a large percentage were over here instead of just staying in the US is because there is a 10% increase in pay and they all got increased rank. If the army as a livelihood (I can't spell anymore never could) should suddenly cease and the saloons should all close at the same time I actually don't know what would happen to those fellows. They're all too good to do an honest day's work and they don't know how if they were willing.\n\nWe have inspection after inspection. There's one every day in the week but Sunday and Monday and there would be one on those days but there's nothing left to inspect and we need at least two days a week to get ready for the other five. I knocked him dead on a stand up inspection yesterday, but one of my corporals fainted after it was over.\n\nI've got to run to catch the train will write tomorrow or next day.

I am ashamed to admit that I haven't written to you for fifteen days but if you are interested in a recital of events since March 6 I'll tell you whats happened and then I hope you'll forgive me. I had two letters from you yesterday and one the day before. It certainly is pleasing to hear you say you are able to be on hand for breakfast, can go to Kansas City and do things as you always have. I've been more worried than you can imagine since you've been sick but I hope the sight of you will cure all my worries forever and if there is no slip, that shouldn't be a far distant event. It seems almost impossible that we're really headed for home and will probably sail before the middle of April. The Divisions ahead of us,are moving before their schedule.\n\nWell to go back to Rosieres - we got the order to entrain on the sixth at Trionville-Narcios some sixteen kilometers from where we were billeted which is the usual arrangement in affairs military. Bar-le-Duc was only six kilometers but for the convenience of some regiments that were more distant we walked sixteen. The 110th ammunition train of which Major Thacher is now a part swiped our trucks and my battery had to walk all the way and carry a full pack half the way. We marched half the distance on the evening of the 5th and stayed all night with Battery B. Got up at 4:45 A.M. and went the balance of the way the next morning in the rain under full pack. Our train consisted of 46 freight cars, French make and two German second and third class passenger coaches for five batteries and the officers. You know all French freight cars are marked Cheveaux 8 Hommes 40 which means that when men are loaded,they must be pretty well squeezed in. There were about 30 to the car. Lt. Col. Gates was in command of the train. (He's been promoted since I last wrote you.) We had a long tiresome ride of two days and nights and were finally unloaded twenty kilometers from our billets although the railroad ran within six of the place where were going. Trucks were supposed to meet us be were late in coming and we started out in full pack on that twenty kilo hike. When the trucks did meet us about 3 kilos from our destination my outfit just kept on marching and whistling and carried their packs the whole way. You can't beat the Irish. If you desert them for the Gorillas when we arrive home I shall certainly be heartbroken because they're not to be mentioned in the same breath. Of course I,don't want you to desert the home folks but I hope you will let Battery D have a small part of your attention anyway.\n\nWe are billeted at a large Chateau about fifteen miles from Le Mans. There are five batteries in the place and it is sure crowded. Bat D. drew the top floor. We have to go up and down 88 steps to get to our quarters. It was certainly a dirty place when the Batteries arrived as places usually are when we arrive. But we will leave it clean. The colonel came overland in an automobile. He came out to look things over and gave us particular dickens because things weren't clean. As most squirrel head Regular Army Officers he can give you hell for things not done but offers no remedy. You may be sure we are going to be strong for the regulars when we get back. If I can help make 'em work the rest of their lives with a pick and shovel I'm going to do it. I am told that 88% of the Regular Army officers were in the S. O. S. 4% in USA and,4% on the fighting front. Fifteen of them were killed. (I don't know how that happened but I reckon there were no reservists or N. G. officers handy to send out in their places. The reason that such a large percentage were over here instead of just staying in the US is because there is a 10% increase in pay and they all got increased rank. If the army as a livelihood (I can't spell anymore never could) should suddenly cease and the saloons should all close at the same time I actually don't know what would happen to those fellows. They're all too good to do an honest day's work and they don't know how if they were willing.\n\nWe have inspection after inspection. There's one every day in the week but Sunday and Monday and there would be one on those days but there's nothing left to inspect and we need at least two,days a week to get ready for the other five. I knocked him dead on a stand up inspection yesterday, but one of my corporals fainted after it was over.\n\nI've got to run to catch the train will write tomorrow or next day. I love you\n\nSincerely\nHarry.\n\nHarry S. Truman\nCapt 129 Fa\nAmer. E.

    "content": "Knights of Columbus \nOverseas Service \nOn Active Service with American Expeditionary Forces\n\nA.P.O. Camp La Beholle near Verdun\nDate Jan. 21 1919\n\nDear Bess:-\nYour grand letter of Dec 26 came last night and of course I was as happy as a kid with a bonbon, I am so glad you had a happy white Christmas. It is a good omen I'm sure and I sincerely hope that \"flu\" will be an unheard of ailment from this time forward. Your point is well taken regarding the furniture in my room at the Hotel Medeterranee (can't spell it). It would of course be essential to provide either a place to eat or a range. I am very sure that I shouldn't have overlooked a vital point like that even if I am blinded by Eros. My experiences to date have taught me most emphatically that it is very very essential that food be provided in plentiful quantities even if clothing has to be overlooked sometimes. Some of my men have been pretty close to nature at various times as to clothes but if there happened to be plenty of roast beef and baked beans it was,a happy lunch. But leave off the eats for a meal or two and it made one \"h- of a mean man\" to put it as they do. Therefore I won't overlook that end of it nor any other I hope. The stationary George and May gave you is simply grand and it makes me sorry to have to answer it on this kind but even this hand is at a high premium here. I think May's picture is pretty fine myself. You know I have two breast pockets in my blouse. Naturally you can guess whose picture stays in the left hand one. I keep May's and Mamma's in the other. Yours is the one you sent me at Doniphon and it has never left me from that day to this nor will it ever. It's been through all the trials and tribulations and happy moments same as I have. I have looked at it many many times and imagined that you were there in spirit as I know you were and its helped a lot especially when things were blue and it would look as if I'd surely blow up if another thing went wrong. I've never blown up and my disposition isn't so very bad. That picture saved it. The biggest worry I've ever had was when I heard that the original of that picture had the \"flu\" and the happiest day was when that letter came saying you'd walked up,Knights of Columbus \nOverseas Service\non Active Service with American Expeditionary Forces\n\nAPO \nDATE\n\n\ntown. I am hoping that Nice will not be an impossibility to us and I don't believe it will. You did right to send your proxy to Boxley. He's to be trusted absolutely.\nWe are having another spasm of moving. There have been orders out twice to move up back to a dirty little old French village but each time Gen. Berry has been able to get them canceled, because we have better quarters here than we can possibly get in a town. I suppose though that we'll go this time. Heard a real good rumor the other day. To show you how they start I'll just trace this one for you. An ordinance sergeant (get that ordAnance) who was overhauling F.Bty's guns told the Lt. who went after them that his own commanding officer, a Lt. had been told by the Generals aide that our guns were being overhauled so that they could be turned in at Le Mans on,Jan 27 which happens to be the Kaiser's birthday (so he said) and then we'd all go home. Now the whole foundation for that nice tale was the definite order for us to move back to a little old village and be billeted not far from Bar-le-Duc and about 40 miles from here. It's my opinion that we'll stay there until Woodie gets his pet peace plans refused or OKed. For my part, and every AEF man feels the same way, I don't give a whoop (to put it mildly) whether there's a league of nations or whether Russia has a Red Government or a Purple one and if the President of the Czechs-Slavocs wants to pry the throne from under the King of Bohemia let him pry but send us home. We came over here to help whip the Hun. We helped a little, the Hun yowled for peace and he's getting in in large doses and if our most excellent ex mayor of Toledo wants to make a hit with us he'll hire or buy some ships and put the Atlantic Ocean between us and the Vin Rouge Sea. For my part I've had enough Vin Rouge and Frogeater victuals to last me a lifetime. And anyway it looks to me like the moon shine business is going to be pretty good in the land of Liberty Loans and Green Trading stamps and some of us want to get in on,Knights of Columbus\nOverseas Service \n\nOn Active Service with American Expeditionary Forces\n\nAPO\nDATE\n\nthe ground floor. At least we want to get there in time to buy in a supply for future consumption. I think a quart of Bourbon would last me about forty years.\nI hope you have a most happy birthday and that you never see another one without me to help celebrate and then may they go on without end. Remember me to your mother and Fred and Frank and Natalie and George and May and just keep writing when you feel inclined because I love you.\nAlways,\nHarry\n\nHarry Truman\nCapt.

You know I have a nice boy in my Battery whose name is Bobby (I have three Bobbys, every one of 'em as fine as boys can be) and once in a while he brings me a letter that he doesn't want any second lieutenant nosing into, and it's always addressed to just Dearest and I feel like an ornery, low-down person when I read them-sometimes I don't, I just sign 'em up and let 'em go.  But if that girl doesn't wait for that kid I know she's got a screw loose.  He doesn't write a thing silly but he's all there and I hope she is too.  What I started out to say is that I'd like to write you a real silly, mushy letter that would honestly express just exactly what I feel tonight but I have command of neither the words nor the diction to do it.  Anyway, I had the most pleasant dream last night and my oh how I did hate to wake up.  Of course I was in U.S.A. parading down some big town's main street and I met you and there was a church handy and just as casually as you please we walked inside and the priest did the rest, and then I thought we were in Paris and I woke up in a Godforsaken camp just outside of old ruined Verdun.  You've no idea how often and constantly that last part is a daydream with me.  It seems that Sam is never, never going to take us home so that priest can be met.  We just live from one inspection to the next.  You know these regular army colonels and lieutenant colonels who've had their feet on the desk ever since the argument started are hellbent for inspections.  Some of 'em haven't been over here but a month or two but they can come around and tell us who went through it exactly and how we did not win the war.  Some of 'em are nuts on horse feed and some are dippy on how to take care of harness and some think they know exactly how many ounces of axle grease will run a gun wheel to kingdom come and back.  One important little major who had evidently read somebody's nonsensical book on how to feed a horse came along the other day and wanted us to feed the horses oatmeal, cooked! and we don't get enough to feed the men for breakfast half the time.  Then another one wanted us to shake all the chaff and dirt out of the hay and give it to the horses and if the horses wouldn't eat the dirt, why we must put salt on it so they would--and we haven't got the salt.  A lieutenant colonel was here today who said they were both crazy and we'd better feed oats and hay as usual, which is exactly what we intended to do anyway.  This peacetime soldering is an awful bore and anybody who wants to do it is certainly off in his upper works.  \n\nIn addition to inspections and more inspections we have to keep our Batteries from going to pieces.  Two of my kids were caught asleep on guard last night and I gave 'em the privilege of going before our summary court and getting a fine maybe or taking what I'd give them.  They seemed to prefer the latter.  Now what do you reckon I'm going to make those poor boys do?  Why, clean out stables all Saturday afternoon and Sunday and wash the muddiest, dirtiest wagon I can produce on Sunday afternoon for four weeks.  I reckon that ought to impress them that an armistice isn't peace, don't you think?  One of 'em is one of my Bobbys, too, and another one is a nephew of the present Grand Matron of Missouri.  The better I like 'em, the meaner I have to be to them just to show 'em that I'm impartial.  You've no idea how I hate to call a man down.  I'd almost rather take a beating than tell a man how good for nothing he is when he's done something he shouldn't.  Two of my men overstayed a pass I gave them to Verdun the other day and I talked so mean to them when they came back that one of 'em cried and I almost let him off without any punishment.  If we stay in this place much longer, I'll either have a disposition like a hyena or be the dippy one.  If there's one thing I've always hated in a man it is to see him take his spite out on someone who couldn't talk back to him.  I've done my very best not to jump on someone under me when someone higher up jumps on me, because I hate the higher-up when he does it and I'm sure the next fellow will hate me if I treat him the same way.  Anyway I can't jump all over a man for doing something that I'm sure I'd have done myself if I'd had the opportunity and been in his place.  Justice is an awful tyrant.  Just to show how she works I took all the privileges away from a fellow for a small offense and gave him a terrific calling down and I had to do it four times more when I found out that four more were offenders in the same way.  One of 'em was a man I particularly like too and I know he thinks I'm as mean as Kaiser Bill.  \n\nWe went for a road march yesterday all hitched up and when I got out in front of a battery again and gave 'em right by section, column left and marched off down the road.  I felt real important.  You've no idea what a feeling it is to look back and see a battery of four guns and a lot of caisons and wagons and a rolling kitchen and one hundred and eight odd men coming along behind you and know that they're yours for the time being and that they start and stop when you say so and will shoot a lot of destruction for you if you'll only direct it right.  But I'd feel as if I were doing more good if I were following that mule I told you of.  I would like to march down Grand Ave. just once though at the head of my Irish Battery just to see what it would be like in an honest to goodness form.\n\nThe mail orderly just brought me the two copies of \"Life\" Fred sent me.  I certainly do appreciate them.  They are excellent numbers I know just from a slight glance through them and they'll amuse me for a week and then the battery until they're completely worn out.  Please thank him most sincerely for me.\n\nI am enclosing another picture of me made by Capt. Patterson.  This one looks more like me and except for a contorted eye caused by the glasses it's all right.  I had to lean over to keep the light from making my eyes white.\n\nI'm afraid this letter will be an awful bore to you but I've just kept thinking of something I wanted to say to you and I've said it.  I'm awful glad the S.O.S. didn't steal your roses and I'm glad you like them.

    "content": "Camp Mills, L.I.\nApril 24, 1919\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI have been in America just four days and I have been so busy just lookin' at the place and getting some honest-to-goodness food under my belt that I haven't had time to do anything else.  \n\nI had the most miserable ten days coming over that I've spent in this war.  We had a fine boat, brand new and never used before, but she was empty except for our baggage and ourselves and she did some rolling.  I am not a good sailor and you can guess the harrowing details.  Of course I could get no sympathy.  Even my own Battery laughed at me.  I lost about twenty pounds (and I can afford to lose it).  For a time I wished most sincerely that I could go back to the Argonne Forest and at least die honorably.  I am bravely over it now and I fear that I am gaining in weight.\n\nI've never seen anything that looked so good as the Liberty Lady in New York Harbor and the mayor's welcoming boat, which came down the river to meet us.  You know the men have seen so much and been in so many hard places that it takes something real to give them a thrill, but when the band on that boat played \"Home Sweet Home\" there were not very many dry eyes.  The hardest of hard-boiled cookies even had to blow his nose a time or two.  Every welfare organization in America met us and gave us something.  The Jews gave us handkerchiefs; the Y.M.C.A. chocolate; the Knights of Columbus, cigarettes; the Red Cross, real homemade cake; and the Salvation Army, God bless 'em, sent telegrams free and gave us Easter eggs made of chocolate.  They took us off the boat at Pier No. 1 in Hoboken, fed us till we wouldn't hold any more, put us on a ferry, and sent us to Camp Mills, where they gave us a bath and lots of new clothes, the first some of the men have had since they joined.  Then we made a raid on the canteens and free shows.  I'll bet ten barrels wouldn't hold the ice cream consumed that first evening.  I was so busy that I didn't connect until the next day but I've been going strong ever since.\n\nI was down on Broadway night before last with Major Miles and Major Wilson and stopped in at an ice cream joint and who do you suppose asked me if I belonged to the 35th Division?  Stella Swope.  She asked me where I was from, what regiment I belonged to, and then if I knew you, before she told me who she was.  I was somewhat embarrassed but managed to tell her.  She was with a sailor but didn't introduce him.\n\nI am so crazy to get home that I'm about to go A.W.O.L. but I guess I'd better not set my Irish a bad example at this late day.  We hope to leave here day after tomorrow for Kansas City, where we parade.  They'd better keep Klemm out of that parade too.\n\nI hope you'll forgive me for not writing oftener while here but it's just so good to have U.S.A. under my feet that I have to look at it somewhat.  My Dago barber gave me an Italian dinner at his sister's house last night—yards and yards of spaghetti, chicken and dumplings, rabbit and peas and all the trimmings.  I nearly foundered myself.  Hope to see you soon and make up for lost time.  Sincerely, I love you\n\nAlways,\nHarry\n\nMiss Bess Wallace\n219 Delaware St\nIndependence\nMissouri,Camp Mills, L.I.\nApril 24, 1919\n\nDear Bess:\n\nI have been in America just four days and I have been so busy just lookin' at the place and getting some honest-to-goodness food under my belt that I haven't had time to do anything else.  \n\nI had the most miserable ten days coming over that I've spent in this war.  We had a fine boat, brand new and never used before, but she was empty except for our baggage and ourselves and she did some rolling.  I am not a good sailor and you can guess the harrowing details.  Of course I could get no sympathy.  Even my own Battery laughed at me.  I lost about twenty pounds (and I can afford to lose it).  For a time I wished most sincerely that,I could go back to the Argonne Forest and at least die honorably.  I am bravely over it now and I fear that I am gaining in weight.\n\nI've never seen anything that looked so good as the Liberty Lady in New York Harbor and the mayor's welcoming boat, which came down the river to meet us.  You know the men have seen so much and been in so many hard places that it takes something real to give them a thrill, but when the band on that boat played \"Home Sweet Home\" there were not very many dry eyes.  The hardest of hard-boiled cookies even had to blow his nose a time or two.  Every welfare organization in America met us and gave us something.  The Jews gave us handkerchiefs; the Y.M.C.A. chocolate; the Knights of Columbus, cigarettes; the Red Cross, real homemade,cake; and the Salvation Army, God bless 'em, sent telegrams free and gave us Easter eggs made of chocolate.  They took us off the boat at Pier No. 1 in Hoboken, fed us till we wouldn't hold any more, put us on a ferry, and sent us to Camp Mills, where they gave us a bath and lots of new clothes, the first some of the men have had since they joined.  Then we made a raid on the canteens and free shows.  I'll bet ten barrels wouldn't hold the ice cream consumed that first evening.  I was so busy that I didn't connect until the next day but I've been going strong ever since.\n\nI was down on Broadway night before last with Major Miles and Major Wilson and stopped in at an ice cream joint and who do you suppose asked me if I belonged to the 35th Division?  Stella Swope.  She asked me where I was from, what regiment I belonged to, and then if I knew you, before she told me who she was.  I was somewhat embarrassed but managed to tell her.  She was with a sailor but didn't introduce him.\n\nI am so crazy to get home that I'm about to go A.W.O.L. but I guess I'd better not set my Irish a bad example at this late day.  We hope to leave here day after tomorrow for Kansas City, where we parade.  They'd better keep Klemm out of that parade too.\n\nI hope you'll forgive me for not writing oftener while here but it's just so good to have U.S.A. under my feet that I have to look at it somewhat.  My Dago barber gave me an Italian dinner at his sister's house last night—yards and yards of spaghetti, chicken and dumplings, rabbit and peas and all the trimmings.  I nearly foundered myself.  Hope to see you soon and make up for lost time.  Sincerely, I love you\n\nAlways,\nHarry,Miss Bess Wallace\n219 Delaware St\nIndependence\nMissouri"

    "content": "Camp La Beholle, near Verdun\nJanuary 7, 1919\n\nDear Bess:\n\nSuch a joyousness—two letters from you last night, one from home, one from Boxley, one from Morgan, and one from some uneasy papa of one of my irresponsibles to know if his son is shot or not.  He isn't and never has been over half-shot since he's been over here.  (I should be shot saying that, because the kid's one of my best corporals.)\n\nYou've no idea how this muddy spot brightens up when letters come.  I was so glad to get yours because I have been scared to death, ever since you told me Frank had the \"flu,\" that either you or your mother would get it.  I'm so glad you're getting well. It had been almost two weeks since I had received a letter and I was certainly uneasy.  Mary was down with it too so you can imagine how I felt.  \n\nGeorge Arrowsmith was in to see me yesterday evening and I told him you had been sick, and he said yes he knew it but wasn't going to tell me if I didn't know it.  Considerate man, isn't he?  Mary says she is much better and I hope that by the next mail I'll hear you are both in excellent health.  \n\nI thought perhaps you'd like to see how I am wasting away, pining to get home and out of the armee, so I'm enclosing you a Kodak picture of me made by Captain Paterson.  I am supposed to be engrossed with a letter to you but inadvertently I am holding a pencil instead of a pen.  I am thinking of you anyway because Paterson remarked that he'd flatter me as much as the camera would admit because he knew you'd like it that way.  Don't you think I'm getting thin?  It took Pat nearly five minutes to get me posed so my double chin wouldn't show!  The colonel says I'm getting thinner. I'm not so obese as I was a week or so ago and I'm still wearing my American uniforms, which by the way are better than any that can be bought over here now.  \n\t\nTell Uncle Strother that I'll certainly get him an iron cross if it is at all possible to obtain one and I'm good and sure it is.  I didn't get one in Verdun the other day because there are no more refugees coming back this way.  I am going over to Mars le Tour next Sunday and will try my luck over there.  In Metz they sell for 3 marks which is about 75 cents in good money.  The Y.M.C.A. is giving a show tonight but I stayed in to finish this letter because I'll have so much to do tomorrow I won't be able to finish it then.  I am going to take the Battery out mounted tomorrow for the first time since it came out of the line.  We have a lot of new horses, American horses, and new harness.  It sure looks good to get lined up like a real battery once more.  Parade ground stuff is great for use in peace time but when honest to goodness shootin' is going on you get in and shoot and a few good cuss words properly placed get more immediate action than all the drill ground maneuvers ever did.  We've got to exercise our horses and keep the men busy so we should worry.  I have some very fine looking horses and I hope I get to keep them until we go home.\n\n\nI do hope you are well and that all danger from that dreadful flu is past.  I am hoping for another letter later than the ninth.  I'm glad you like the 77s.  They don't amount to much as a present but they are worth something for their associations and the Vosges, Saint-Mihiel, Argonne-Meuse, and Verdun are the fronts the 129th worked on.  \n\nYours always\nHarry\n\nOfficers Mail\n\n[illegible] U.S. ARMY, [illegible]\nJAN 19\n2 PM\n1919\n\nMiss Bess Wallace\n219 Delaware St\nIndependence\nMo\nU.S.A.\n\nA.E.F.

Had first returned from a three day trip on foot and on horseback to turn in my guns. It snowed and sleeted the night before something like an inch. It must have been mixed with rain because that inch stayed on the road in the form of solid ice. It took me from 7 A.M. to 6 P.M. to go 40 kilometers. I walked most of the way because my horse had on slick shoes. That was Thursday. Friday it snowed all day while I was turning in the property and then cleared off and got as cold as the very mischief. I reckon it would have frozen the proverbial brazen monkey. I managed to get a good place to stay but the men were not so fortunate. Some of 'em slept in a pretty cold barrack; but they didn't kick because they think that everything is helping to get us nearer home and I guess it is. Comming [sic] back to Rosieres yesterday was a hard job. Because the roads are still all covered with ice and a horse can hardly stand. I had some to fall as many as five times but the driver was always lucky enough to get away unhurt. It was about the worst march of the war for me and that is saying quite a bit. We hope to turn in our horses soon and then we'll go to Le Mans and make up our papers and unwind a couple of thousand miles of pink tape and perhaps be home by spring. That of course all depends on the humor the commanding general of the S.O.S. when he looks us over.\n\nI am at the officers Y.M.C.A. in Bar-le-Duc today trying to get warm and incidentally get a bath if such a thing is possible. France you know doesn't believe in heat in the winter time and baths are for summer also. The Y.M.C.A. here is going to fix things up for us though and I reckon we'll go home satisfied.\n\nYou've no idea how I liked your letter especially when you asked me if I can do a days work on lemon pie and chocolate cake. I can work the rest of my life on those two luxuries if I can only have you to make them. If I can go a whole week under fire and have only corned millie and hard bread with boiled potatoes sometimes and still come out whole mentally(?) and physically you can rest assured that anything you'll choose to fix up will be as nectar for the gods.\n\nYour insinuation that you might be a Marie Louis was rather hard to take though. You'll remember she was No 2 and I've spent the last few years trying strenuously to make you believe that you never could run second with me. Eugenie belonged to Napoleon all right but not the Napoleon and that is no worse than my trying to tell you that Richelieu issued the Edict of Nantes in one of my letters with I was trying to indicate to you where I was going to school.\n\nI am going to send you a telegram tomorrow hoping it will reach you by your birthday. I hope you have a happy one and never spend another without me to help you celebrate it.\n\nI am having a hard time to get that iron cross for Uncle Strother but I hope to make it before I leave. Just missed getting one the other day from a fellow on leave from Coblenz. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.\n\nIt is so bloomin cold in my billet and fire wood is so scarce that I haven't written you for several days but I'll make it up when I see you which I hope will be soon. C. C. Bunschu was given an efficiency board - unjustly I am happy to say and I guess he'll beat us home. I don't know if I told you that K. D. K. is transferred to the 106th F.A. because it's going home sooner that we are and we have Col. Smith. There wasn't much sorrow when he left among either officers or men.

It was made more joyous by two letters from you. The days are always fine when mail from home comes even when it's raining. My first sergeant reminded me of a day in the drive when I was chasing around figuring a barrage and raising sand with everyone in sight when the mail man gave me a letter from you and I calmed down at once and forgot the barrage, battery and everything else for a while. You won't be the only one to weep when we meet I'm afraid. I'm glad you like the pictures. They flatter me considerably but then we all like picture that make us look better than we are. It was no joke about that fool horse inspector wanting us to cook oats for our horses. He was canned shortly afterwards though and my horses are gone to Germany or somewhere else now and I don't have horse inspectors to worry about any more, and I hope I never have. We only have inspection of the men now - clothes, billets, mess etc etc. I didn't take any pleasure in making that fellow cry who overstayed his time in Verdun and I'd rather be beaten than call a man down but I have to do it to make 'em behave and to keep my job with honor and efficiency. It's one of the many requirements in Army Regulations to make men obey the rules but I don't like to do it. And as for ever thinking of calling you down - why I'd go jump in the river first. I can't even remember of having called Mary down for anything badly as she needs it sometimes. You'll have to do all the disciplining in our household because my heart fails me on cronic [sic] rule breakers and hard cookies in the army if they put up the right kind of talk.\n\nI'm so sorry to hear of Mrs. Bryant's death. Please extend my heartfelt sympathy to Helen. There's nothing much you can do or say in a case of that kind because it's something we've all got to look forward to but may the day be far distant when either of us have to face the same situation.

Klemm] was not popular with officers nor men but he played no favorites. He was just as mean to one as another and I think it was a policy he inaugurated from some mistaken idea of German discipline being the best brand. He's been transferred to the 106th at his own request because it's going home before we do. To give him his due he is an efficient officer and would have been a Brigadier General had the war gone on another sixty days. I'm off of him for life but I don't care about its being made public property just yet. He didn't treat me any worse than he did the rest of his B. C. but my Irish thought he did and probably conversed more about him than they should have. Take all the early talk from the first arrivals with a grain of salt because I'm sure they'll talk too much. I hope I shan't have to say a word when I get home either in public or in private about anyone of the 129th to hurt his standing at home. As I told you C.

I sure feel sorry for Henry Allen if this outfit ever gets to him.\n\nBe sure and keep writing because the letter'll follow us up even to Funston. I love you\n\nAlways\nHarry.\n\nHarry S.

If Mr. Dickey had gotten his streets accepted he'd have been pleased with,the operation of the court. \n\nOur regiment is to put on a parade this afternoon in which I have no part, thank goodness.\n\nI am very sorry you didn't get that other special if I'd known they were to deliver it the same day I'd certainly have send you another. I really did look my eyes out thinking that perhaps someone would have a good heart and bring you up. It will sure be good to see you Thursday.\n\nYes you can come for me Sunday afternoon if you like and I won't have to do so much packing. I'm crazy to see you.\n\nLove XXXX\nHarry.,[cancellation stamp] Ft. Leavenworth Kans. 5 PM Jul 23 1923\n\n[handwritten] Mrs. Harry S. Truman\n219 No Delaware St.\nIndependence,\nMo. [/handwritten]"

You might accidentally leave the opening statement exposed and someone would be sure to say we were a couple of idiots if I should start off \"Dear Hon\" or \"Sweetie\" or \"Honey Bunch\" or a half-dozen equally descriptive and proper words.\n\nJames and I had a very satisfactory trip and would have,been here by nine o'clock had we not run into a small chuckhole and broken a front spring.  The hole was not half as large as forty or fifty we'd been over before but the old spring broke right in the center just as completely as if it had been sawed with a hack saw, every leaf.  I had another put on this morning for $7.50, half of which Jimmy insists on standing so I won't be out so awful much,,might have broken it if I'd stayed home.  We had to make a detour and I went through Lamar, the first time I've been there since I was a year old.  I couldn't see much change in the town except that Pop's old livery stable apparently is a garage now.\n\nThe convention opened with a bang.  The mayor turned the town over to us, and a Hebrew gentlemen by the name of Herowitz,read an address from Governor Hyde.  We accused him of writing it himself but he said he didn't.  I told him I didn't think Hyde could write as good a speech as that.\n\nWe are invited out to a chicken dinner at the club tonight.  It is strictly stag so don't get uneasy.  Jimmy is trying to get the state headquarters moved to Independence but I don't think it can be done.  It looks as if Carl Grey will,be the next commander.  George Cowls is here.  I saw Ralph a little bit ago.  He's taken the pledgeâsays he's not drinking any more.  I hope it sticks.\n\nI was pretty homesick last night and am yet.

I'm glad the baby's eye is better. I did a kid trick last night. I wanted to see you and Skinny so badly after supper that I backed my car out without anyone seeing me and started up the road in the direction of home and with the intention of going there too. After I'd driven about an hour I saw a sign which said Topeka seventy miles and I began to figure that the best I could do would be to arrive about 1:00 p.x. and perhaps scare you all to death so I turned around and came on back. Besides, I had to read all the rules in all the artillery books today so I could give the men who fired a square deal when I checked them. Jay Lee, Bachelor, and I have spent the whole afternoon checking up on them. It's harder to keep,track of a man and grade him than it is to fire yourself.\n\nHow do you like my new stationery? I let a fellow go to church in my car and it was <scratched out> fil </scratched out> full of gas, he wanted to do something for me, so he stopped by the club and bought me some stationery.\n\nI went down and watched the Missouri National Guard regiment unload just before noon.

A real sweetheart letter. I like 'em that way. It is fine the baby's eyes are getting well. Do you know where she got them? The shirts came and I'm very glad to get them. They'll be fine this evening after supper.\n\nWe went to the firing point this morning at 7:30 started on time and fired fourteen problems. I have seven Lts in my section to watch but they are all good men and give me very little trouble.\n\nDon't you worry about your pretty hair any more go and cut it off and please yourself. As I said before you'll be just as beautiful to me if you have those curls. I'll never forget or if you have none at all. It's you I'm in love with not,what you're made of.\n\nI hope it's cooler there than it is here although it isn't too hot to stand.\n\nThe gang is falling in.

The lightning killed three mules down at the National Guard camp but injured no one else. It was so muddy the war was called off and we didn't go to the firing point this morning. Instead we went to a cavalry lecture and then the Battery A horses were saddled and everyone went riding but Batchelor and myself. We had to prepare some lectures on material etc. Batchelor also had a stiff neck and I took him to the hospital to get it mended.\n\nJust went into the dining room and got your letter. It was good of you to send the clipping about the J.Ps. I did not see it.\n\nI've been so afraid my daughter would forget me. I did not know what to do. I'm glad you are keeping her informed on who her daddy is anyway.,That bob expert at the Baltimore was in my canteen barber shop. His name is Baker and if you'll tell him you are Mrs. H.S.T., he'll spread himself to do you a good job. He was in Battery A - Keith Dancy's Battery in the war. I'm sorry Natalie and Frank can't agree but I'm satisfied she'll have her way. They always do. I should have made you get your teeth fixed before you operated.\n\nI had a note from Mamma and a report from Miss Reyling. It was a very good week at the club. Just as well as if I'd been present. So my worries were all for naught. Be sure and kiss the young lady.\n\nYours always, Harry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"FORT RILEY KANS.

I think told you I don't care what they look like so long as I get 'em. I think it looked pretty good. I am certainly glad the baby's eye is improving, but I am so sorry to hear of the heat you are enduring. If I was any good I'd have the where with to send you where its cooler. You see what worries me is the fact that you and the kid are entitled to the world and an acre on the outside and I can't give it too you.\n\nThe general and the officers of the cavalry school came over to our dance hall last night and gave us a reception. It was hotter than blazes with my best bib and tucker on. The Gen and all the reserves stood in line while all the post officers and their wives and the N. G. officers walked,around the circle and tell who they were and shake hands. It was a long drawn out affair. Then they showed us a picture of activities at Riley. It was very interesting.\n\nWe went out firing this morning and I fired the 1st problem. It was not very well done. Batchelor fired an excellent one. I can still fire however although I'm out of practice and can't see as well as I once could. I'm afraid I won't get the cup.\n\nI do hope you have better weather and that you both feel better. It's only three more days. But keep writing. Kiss my kiddie for me.\n\nYour Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY KANS. FT. RILEY BR.

You should not have missed any because I've mailed one every day. I sent one into Junc. City day before yesterday by a 2nd Lt and he may have failed to mail it. I'm glad Miss Mary Margaret is getting on so well. It is a long time since I've seen you both and you don't know how badly I want to see you.\n\nI bungled my problem this morning and muffed my chance for the cup. For some reason my brain doesn't function as quickly nor half so clearly as it formerly did. I can figure everything out in advance to the dot and I can stand and watch the officer firing,and make every change as it ought to be long before he is ready and then when I get up to do it my mind goes dizzy on me and blooie I mess my chance. If it was on the front I'd do it right but a critical audience spoils the game. You've four things to do every time the guns go off. You must get the direction correctly; they must be properly distributed in relation to one another, the height of the burst must be properly adjusted and you must be able to see if they are short or over. Your mind must be clear and you've got to think of nothing but what you're doing. I've an idea Batchelor will win the cup. He fired another good one today. I'm sorry I didn't call you. I had the urge at the same time you were thinking of it. Kiss my kiddie.\n\nYours always Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"FORT RILEY KANS.

Where did Miss M. get her bad eye? It sure was a surprise to me to hear that she has a bad one. I do hope it's nothing serious. I am glad your ankle is improving. The box came today and I was very glad to get the stocks as I only had one. Laundry service is not the best in the world here and I only had one white stock. We have to dress up in the evening, either in civies or full-dress uniform. It's a good thing I brought my civilian clothes. They are very handy when it's hot.\n\nI think I told you I went swimming yesterday and it was the coldest pool I was ever in. Minnesota lakes have nothing on it. Our,coldest pool I was ever in. Minnesota lakes have nothing on it. Our showers are the same way. I can't understand what causes it. I got the colonel to let us ride to work in cars this morning and it has improved the morale considerably. We'd been walking a mile and a half to a lecture, then riding some rough ponies for an hour, and then walking another mile to another lecture and then walking back a mile and a half to the noon meal and then walking to the lecture room and back at three-thirty. Some of those birds looked like a picked chicken after two days of it and now we use the cars. I saw a fellow just now who says he loves his wife as much as I do mine. He writes her every day anyway.

I hadn't signed out though and the round trip would have made me so tired I couldn't have acted with any satisfaction on the firing. We begin firing tomorrow at 7 A.M. and keep it up 5 hours a day for five days. I have to make up the records of the officers doing the firing. Col. Klemm is giving a cup for it.\n\nManhattan is a very nice town. Jay Lee's sister lives there. He went over to see her today.\n\nI went down and watched them unload a regiment of National Guard,artillery this morning. The Missouri regiment - 128th F.A. is to train here this week & next. I saw some of my old men in the outfit and it was like seeing long lost friends or kinsfolk. They are a fine looking bunch of men. One of my sergeants is horse sergeant for the battery from Clinton and one of my corporal is a Lt. in the battery from Marysville. One of the 129th Lts is now a Major. I'm glad I took my promotion. They can't highhtone me anyway. I hope the baby's eyes are all right. I didn't get any letter today. It makes it seem very long. Be sure and write me every day.\n\nYour\n Harry."

It consisted of going by them on their front porch and off at the other end and away. He always kids me about my political career and I tell him if there weren't politicians to run the government, he would not be a brigadier general. That usually stops the conversation?at least it did last evening.\n\nWe had a horseback ride this A.M. in addition to our other duties. It was not very strenuous. I can use that swimming suit if it isn't too much trouble to send it. This day has been much brighter because of your note.,I am very sorry about your foot. If you'd just be as anxious to take care of yourself as you are to doctor me and the young lady, you'd be all right nine times in ten. You should have had the doctor when your foot first hurt you.\n\nI wish I could take you and the baby \"bye.\" I guess it was pretty selfish in me to come off up here and leave you and take the car and I shouldn't have done it.

We're going on a cross country ride at 8:30 and get back at 11 o'clock. This morning we drilled the battery mounted. Col. Elliott was battery commander. Lt. Col. Bachelor was chief of the 1st section. Graves of the 2nd I had the 3rd and Major Bryant the 4th; the captains and lts. had to drive the horses to the carriages. So you,see it was a rather high powered battery. Lt Cols & Majors for sergeants captains for drivers and Colonels for Captains. It was a very good arrangement. Everyone enjoyed it. I didn't come home because it would cost $10.00 to make the round trip and I wouldn't have accomplished much only to get all the weeks worries on my mind and I decided I'd get 'em next Saturday.

I'm sure sorry you didn't get the letter on Wednesday because I've never missed a day. The mail is handled from a box in front of the dining room. It is collected at 9:45 AM and 2:45 P.M. On the first two days I missed the 2:45 collection and mailed one on the train at 9:30 P.M. going west and took the other one to Junction City about 8:30 P.M. One I mailed in the box before I knew the hours of collection. I am straightened out now and I guess you'll,connect regularly from this on. It looks as if I'm not going to be able to make the grade on Saturday. The schedule runs right through and we are likely to be busy right up to Saturday evening. Besides I'm trying for a record and I don't want to spoil it. We had a fine ride this morning and are going out to watch the Battery put on a demonstration this P.M.\n\nI'm glad that you are feeling well and that the baby is all right. I'm so afraid she won't know me when I get home I don't know what to do. I've turned as brown as an Indian and am feeling fine. The swimming pool isn't deep or large and its always full of the finest swimmers. So don't worry. Be sure and write,\nYour Sweetie Harry.\n\nJay Lee wants to be remembered to you and our family.

I am very sure you'll be just as beautiful with it off and I'll not say anything to make you sorry for doing it. I can still,see you as the finest on earth so go and have it done. I've never been right sure you weren't kidding me anyway. You usually do as you like about things and that's what I want you to do.\n\nI hope that you and the baby are both well and not entirely roasted. We've never been uncomfortably hot although yesterday was a stinger. Be sure and let me hear from you. The days are awful dull without the letters. I doubt if I'm to come home Friday or not. If I can't, I can't that's all. We had a fine ride this A.M. and we're going to pistol practice shortly.\n\nLots of love to you and kiss my baby, Harry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"FORT RILEY KANS.

We got to Topeka at 10:00, Manhattan at 12:30, where we had a good dinner on Colonel Elliott. The roads were very good - not a bad place in them. There is only one drawback to the arrangement - I am quartered in the same room with the colonel and Captain Percy Fleming. I guess I can stand it though.\n\nI hope your foot is much better and that Miss M.M. is behaving as she should. There is only one drawback to this camp business. I can't have you,both with me. I sure do miss you. I hope you are feeling all right. I am rather tired and hot but there is a good breeze blowing.\n\nClaude Sowers let me have this paper so I could start the week right. I hope you are doing the same thing. My mind is rather blank and I hope I can do better tomorrow.\nI love you, Harry\n\nKiss Miss Skinny for me.\nPlease look in my right hand top drawer and send me the ornament for my hat.

Took a bus for Sterling and got a Santa Fe train for this place. Mr. Moses, of the Moses Milling Co., met us in a big Hudson sedan and the president of the Chamber of Commerce was there in his Buick sedan. We are billed to speak to the Lions Club at noon, after which these gentlemen are going to drive us over to Larned for a 3:00 P.M. meeting and a Chamber of Commerce meeting at six-thirty at Kinsley, after which they will drive us to Dodge. This is almost like campaigning for President except that the people are making promises to me instead,<letterhead> Hotel Zarah Great Bend Kansas </letterhead>\n\nof the other way around. They sure do treat us royally. The Rumanian Queen had nothing on us.\n\nThe weather is ideal, as pretty a day as you can wish for. This a beautiful town and seems to be plumb full of live wires. I do hope I get a letter in Dodge. Bill Francisco was at Lyons. He's straightened up and is making good as a salesman for the Rock Island Imp. Co.\n\nYou sure ought to be along. We'd have the time of our lives. I've got a trip all arranged to California for next fall if you want to take it. Kiss my baby and take a carload for yourself.

Your letter came, we had a fine and successful meeting, got our pictures in both evening Dayton paper and got back as far as Indianapolis on the return trip. It was a grand and glorious feeling when your letter came this morning, appreciated the clipping, digested what you said of my friend Mr. Hall and am filing it away for future reference. I'd like to see both you and the young lady.\n\nThere was some very fine and intelligent men here to talk over,<letterhead>                                                          Hotel Lincoln\n                                                                                On the National Trail Highway\n                                                                                         Indianapolis                               </letterhead>  \n\nthe situation with us. Mr. Corcoran, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce of Wheeling, W.

Mgr. of the Dayton Chamber of Com. Mr. Wayne Lee, and Mr. Ackerman of the Dayton Auto Club. I dictated a plan of action to the Auto Club Steno and it was adopted verbatim. All that had to be done now is work out a financial plan and that is tentatively agreed on.,<letterhead>                                                                               Hotel Lincoln\n                                                                                              On the National Trail Highway\n                                                                                                             Indianapolis                               </letterhead>  \n\nThe National Old Trails is back on the map east of Indiana and is there to stay.\n\nThis is some city. We left Dayton in a snow storm but ran out of it about 40 miles this side and it is now clear with the moon shining. We ate supper in Jas. Whitcomb Riley's town of Greenfield. The \"old swimming' hole\" is just outside of town but it was a little chilly to go try it.\n\nWe arrived here at eight and got settled, then went out and walked over the downtown,<letterhead>                                                                               Hotel Lincoln\n                                                                                           On the National Trail Highway\n                                                                                                      Indianapolis                               </letterhead>  \n\nsection. It's a lot easier to walk over it than to find a place to park. We'd expected to stay at the Washington Hotel, a copiously road advertised house, but we couldn't find it anywhere so we stopped here. This is a bigger and finer place we discovered after stumbling onto the Washington while walking around. We came across it right on the street we came in on but after placarding [sic] the roads for a hundred miles in each direction, the sign wasn't big enough to see on the Hotel itself. \n\nThe Claypool is right across,<letterhead>                 Hotel Lincoln\n                                On the National Trail Highway\n                                      Indianapolis                               </letterhead>  \n\nthe street from here. That is where all the Indiana politics is brewed. It covers a whole block and has been here for a long time. We hope to see some of the Indianapolis politicians tomorrow.\n\nWe have to see the Pres of the Chamber of Com., the Auto Club and the Mayor or Manager if they have one. Probably got our pictures in the Indianapolis papers too.\n\nWe'll go to St. Louis tomorrow night and be home Thursday night. I'm going to call you on the phone.

At Kinsley the road forks going east and the new Santa Fe Trail goes by way of St. John and Syracuse to Hutchinson and Emporia.

Larned and Kinsley each have had signs up directing traffic away from the other but they each claimed that some outside town on the other road had put up the sign.

This Old Man Moses I rode down with on the train from Kinsley and in the auto to that place is not the Kansas Milling Co. Moses but is a financier of these parts.

Davis tells me he's worth a million or two. He has two sons and some granddaughters in whom he seems to be very much interested. He gave his department stores to the managers who had been with him longest and organized a finance company to run his banks and gave them to his sons. He is still burdened with his real estate. His wife died in June, but he told me that they had seen everything on the American continent and most of Europe before she died and that he intended to keep their big house in Great Bend running just as if she were alive for they both believed in,<letterhead> \n                                                                Santa Fe\n                                           Eating House and Dining Car System\n                                                         Fred Harvey Manager\n\n                                                                                             Dodge City, Kansas </letterhead>         \n\ngetting everything out of life there is in it. He came here from Sedalia, Missouri, in 1874 after taking a much shot-up trip across Colorado to San Francisco and Portland. He said his brother was sheriff of Great Bend when he arrived and that the cheif deputy killed a man that night and his brother had to kill one the next day.

I took a bath and ate as much as a horse. Salisbury and Bundschu arrived about two hours later. They went out to Olathe instead of taking the Victory Highway. We waited for them in Topeka and lost about forty minutes. Had a good breakfast in Topeka of grapefruit, oatmeal, toast and a glass of milk.\n\nIt has been pretty hot up here today, but there is a very,good prospect for rain. It is much cooler this evening.\n\nI am going to have a real job. The regiment was organized this evening and my labors have started. There is one thing certain I won't have time to worry about things at home politics or finances either.\n\nI wish I could see my honey and my baby this evening and I'd then be perfectly happy.

It lasted until 3 o'clock this afternoon with time out for lunch. We succeeded in getting Larned and Kinsley to let the wind dispose of their signboards tonight and all the towns from Garden City to Herington have buried the hatchet and are now pulling hammer and tongs for the National Old Trails Road. I also got them to pass a resolution favoring a State Highway Commission for Kansas, similar to ours in Missouri. That was a real accomplishment because the Kansans are 'agin\" it on general,<letterhead> \n                                                                Santa Fe\n                                           Eating House and Dining Car System\n                                                         Fred Harvey Manager\n\n                                                                                             Dodge City, Kansas </letterhead>    \n\nprinciples. The president and sec. of the Chamber of Commerce wanted us to stay two days more and do some more fixing, but I told them we had some to do at Marshall Missouri and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nI met Ham Bell, who was mayor of South Dodge at the same time Bat Masterson was mayor of North Dodge. One lies south of the R.R. and the other north of it. They tell me that the Hon. Ham was not so pious in those days as he is now. He's a pillar of the Methodist Church and places a bouquet on the altar every Sunday now, but they tell it on him that in days gone by, when he ran a dance,<letterhead> \n                                                                Santa Fe\n                                           Eating House and Dining Car System\n                                                         Fred Harvey Manager\n\n                                                                                             Dodge City, Kansas </letterhead>    \n\nhall in the part of the city of which he was the presiding officer, he was pitched bodily over into his part of town by the invincible Mr. Masterson when he came across the track to meet some ladies from Wichita who were going to work for him. It seems that inhabitants of the two sections were supposed to stay in their own bailiwicks and if they ventured into strange territory, they did so at their own bodily risk. It seems that Mr. Bell thought he could get over to the train and back without attracting attention, but a long scar on his face shows that he failed. He's forgotten it and no,<letterhead> \n                                                                Santa Fe\n                                           Eating House and Dining Car System\n                                                         Fred Harvey Manager\n\n                                                                                             Dodge City, Kansas </letterhead>    \n\none can persuade him to mention it, but gossipy neighbors spilled the beans.\n\nWe went out to old Ft. Dodge, southeast of here on the Arkansas River, just to say we were there. It is now a soldier's home and not interesting to look at except that it was an Indian frontier about sixty years ago. The fort is four miles from town because it was against the law to sell booze within that distance of a government post in those days and when the R.R. came they had to start the town four miles away. They showed us \"Boot Hill,\" where they buried the gentlemen who were slow on the draw in,<letterhead> \n                                                                Santa Fe\n                                           Eating House and Dining Car System\n                                                         Fred Harvey Manager\n\n                                                                                             Dodge City, Kansas </letterhead>    \n\nan argument. It has a schoolhouse on in, a large brick structure which the city has outgrown. It has been abandoned as a school for a better one and is now vacant. The Catholics built a fine hospital here and some of the \"Sheet Bros.\" bought \"Boot Hill\" to build a finer one but fell out among themselves, as usual, and it's still Boot Hill with an old schoolhouse on it. I am enclosing you a picture of it.\n\nWe're leaving at 7:00 P.M. and will be home Friday. You really don't know how awful glad I was to hear from you.

It made the day really worthwhile. We are on our way to Manhattan this morning to look over and study a G.P.F. 155 Rifle. It will shoot ten miles and make a hole in the ground you can throw a house into. It rained last night and we are going over on the streetcar, hence this shaky writing, so don't accuse me of being drunk as you once,did when I wrote you a letter on a French train.\n\nI was in Junction City to dinner last night at the hotel. Captain Milburn took Captain Hyde, Captain Hurd, Majors Bryant and Salisbury, and myself over and we had a very pleasant evening. Colonel Griswold, who is a state senator from Nebraska, has asked us over to the hotel for dinner tonight. I took him over last week. There are lots of politicians here. We have a great time trying to get our campaign funds out of the poker game. Be sure and kiss my baby. Wish I could see you.\nYour Harry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"MANHATTAN KANS.

I felt rather sheepish to have you worrying so about me when I never had had more fun, felt better or had been more courteously and cordially received. I almost grabbed the first train home. I want to see you and my daughter so badly.\n\nWe had a fine dinner at the Harvey House at Dodge and left there at 7:30 arriving here at 11:55. I couldn't go to bed without talking to you and I was afraid if I called up you'd think I was killed or something and so I'll just,<letterhead> Hotel Stanley, Hutchinson, Kansas </letterhead>\n\nwrite.  This is Armistice Day. Eight years ago, if I remember rightly, I was up figuring a barrage to fire on Hermevile and Grimaoucourt down in front of Verdun. I fired at 3:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M., and at 5:30 A.M. old \"Pat\" (Paterson) called up from Klemm's headquarters and told me that the firing would probably cease at 11:00 A.M. because he had been reliably informed that Foch had signed an armistice to take effect then, but for me not to tell anyone. I think he did every captain the same way. I went on and fired 163 more rounds through the fog and then sure enough at 11:00 A.M. it turned out to be true. Sermon,<letterhead> Hotel Stanley, Hutchinson, Kansas </letterhead>\n\ncalled and said cease firing. I hadn't fired any since 9:00 A.M., but an old French 155 (6-inch) Battery behind me kept right on right up to 11:00 A.M., shooting as hard as they could just to be shooting. The commander said because they had beaucoup ammunition.\n\nThen a few days after that I got a letter from you saying you'd nearly died with the flu and I felt just as I did at Dodge this morning. I hadn't suffered much except loss of sleep and worry for my outfit and here nearly all I had in the world was nearer the great divide than I'd ever been because I never believed,<letterhead> Hotel Stanley, Hutchinson, Kansas </letterhead>\n\nmy name was on a bullet.\n\nThe sun came through the fog right at 11 A.M. for the first time in months (since August I believe) and shined as fine as you please for an hour or two. Everything got so still it made us figity. All we could do was gap and grin and look at each other. If I'd had the wherewithal I'd surely have fallen off the wagon but I didn't.\n\nI am ashamed now that I didn't stay at home and fight the job hunters and take you to see the queen. I'm afraid I'm not as thoughtful of your pleasure as I ought to be. If ever I can connect, you'll never want to do anything you can't. Kiss the baby. I wish I could hear her say \"Lo Dad.\"\n\nAll the love to you,\n\nYour Harry,[penciled marks],<letterhead> Hotel Stanley, Hutchinson, Kansas </letterhead>\n\nWe go to Hennnington in the A.M. at 9:55 arriving there about noon.  Then we'll drive over to Junction City stay all night and if the car holds together be home Friday morning.\n\nThe road they tell me are all right now but I'm going where I can get hard surface as soon as possible.  Don't worry. We've more than accomplished our purpose. I've met some of the biggest and finest men in Kansas and I feel as fine as a fiddle.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"K.C. & TUC[illegible] R.P.O.

I was afraid my Sunday A.M. letter didn't go out until Monday.\n\nWe were supposed to fire this morning and yesterday morning but the schedule was changed on us and we failed to get started at. We went to Manhattan yesterday and did duty as gunners on a 155 gun they have up there. This morning I assigned all the officers as cannoneers and B.C. detail men and the Captain of the Battery put them through their paces. He did a good job of it.\n\nWe have a map problem this afternoon and tomorrow we fire. There is a shortage of ammunition and we can't,fire but about 350 rounds.

Stopped at Higginsville by making a 5 1/2 mile detour and picked up Mr. Hopkins, president of the Traders Bank of Lexington and V.P. Natl Old Trails Road Assn. Had a fine meeting at Marshall. Independence, Lexington, Dover, Arrowrock, & Columbia were represented. We left there after the meeting at about 3:30 and arrived in Boonville at 5 P.M. Called on the newspaper man who, it developed, is a cousin of Dr. Nelson's and is called Edgar Nelson.

He sent for Dr. Nelson to come over and call on us but the,<letterhead>                                                                    On Government Transcontinental Highway No. 40, \"Midway\" between Kansas City and St. Louis\n                                                                                                                                                 Daniel Boone Tavern\n                                                                                                                                                       Columbia, Mo.                            </letterhead>\n\nDr. was not available.

We ran into a football game and (my pen ran dry at that point) came very nearly having to sleep in the street. The clerk told us he had only rooms with cots and sent us up to look at them. He made a mistake and sent us to one of his real rooms, which we immediately signed up for. We'll leave here about 8 AM, stop in Fulton about 10 and aim to get to Greenville, Ill at stopping time tomorrow.\n\nI had such a terrible time getting out of Independence. I never did call you because I couldn't. It was 10:30 before I shook off,all the leeches and on account of the detour to Higginsville I couldn't get to Marshall on time if I stopped.

I was afraid my Sunday letter was a dud for I saw my orderly emptying the mail box the next morning.\n\nWe went out this A.M. and fired a bunch of problems. The officers did very well, but of course they are not so good as the gang last year because they haven't had the experience.\n\nThere is a young man by the name of Fisher who is a Lieut in the regiment. He was a pvt &,sgt. in 129 F.A. He's crazy about photography and has taken pictures of us in every position possible. There'll be some many of them that you can see what has been done all the way through.\n\nI thank you for the sample ballot. It is all right as far as I can see.\n\nI am thinking of my family. I don't do much else. I haven't missed a day on letters and I'm sorry you missed. I tried to call up but didn't get you. Keep on writing.\n\nKiss my baby.

Mr. Southern seems to be taking some active interest in politics. He usually does that when there is nothing to fight about. I hope your mother is much better. You'd better have that cistern water analyzed and not let the young lady have any but boiled.\n\nThis has been a very busy day. We fired from 7:30 to 11:30 and came in had dinner and then I had to assemble my Majors and Colonels and,give them all a paper job in a map problem under the direction of Major Gruber, the artillery officer for the post. He's a very bright man and a classmate of Col. Danford's. We then fought an imaginary war in the mess hall. My job was to keep everyone else busy and not be busy myself.\n\nLast night I called on the General and had a very pleasant evening. I wanted him to help me get some slides made of firing pictures. He accommodated me and I had a pleasant visit besides. He always kids me about my political ambitions and I told,<letterhead> Harry S. Truman Independence, Missouri </letterhead>\n\nhim that politics and the army were equally uncertain.\n\nWe are having a party tonight. The annual banquet of the reserves is some affair. There'll be a badger fight, some boxing bouts, and speeches by unit commanders. I was so rushed today that I didn't get to write this at noon, as I should have, and I doubt if you'll get it as soon as you should.\n\nThere's a rumor around here to the effect that we can't leave until Monday but I hope it's,unfounded.\n\nKeep writing. Kiss my baby?how I'd like to see her and her mamma.\n\nxxxxx \n50-50 \nFrom your \nHarry"

We left Columbia about eight-thirty this morning and stopped in Fulton to see Nick Cave, the senator from that town in the state legislature. He invited us out to his house and was very cordial to us. We arrived in St. Louis about one-thirty and came on out here. Found George's Hotel, and just now phoned the president of the Chamber of Commerce. He's coming down to see us after a while. We've seen the local newspaperman, who said our names and business would be in the paper tomorrow.\n\nThis hotel is run by an old fat codger who is very good humored but he has a tough egg for a wife. She made a couple of kids take their pup out of her hotel lickety-split just now. They were tourists,<letterhead>                                           The Thomas Hotel\n                                                            S. M. Thomas, Proprietor\n                                                                Greenville, Ill.                         </letterhead>  \n\n\nsame as we are, but my sympathies are always with the kids. The old lady told them they could take their dog up to the garage and let him stay in the car, which they did.\n\nWe are now traveling on the National Pike, which was surveyed and laid out in Thomas Jefferson's administration to get communication with Louisiana Territory. That was done along about 1806. Last year or the year before the road was finally paved into St. Louis. Quick action what? We've gone from wheels on the ground to wheels on steel and now we are back on the ground. What, I wonder will be the next step?\n\nThe National Old Trail is really on the map here. They have hotels, eating houses, garages, and drugstores all named for it. So you see we won't,<letterhead>                                                                     The Thomas Hotel\n                                                                                             S.

I thought I'd get a letter as soon as I arrived and I found none. I was so disappointed that I went off to a show before I wrote this. Then I got to thinking that maybe you had so much to do Saturday that you couldn't write and maybe after you wrote Sunday it didn't get off until Monday, in which case that's today and I,<letterhead>                                                                           Hotel Gibbons, Dayton, Ohio                    </letterhead>\n\nwon't get it until morning. But I sure did want it.\n\nWe left Greenville, Illinois, this morning at 7:00 A.M. Old man Thomas, who is the proprietor of the Thomas Hotel, proved to be a right interesting old man. He told me about a former saloonkeeper of his town who was such a good citizen and ran such a clean place that all the high collars and \"the ribbon ladies\" (Thomas called them that) looked on him with favor. He told me all that to impress upon me how nice it is to leave your widow,<letterhead>                                                                                      Hotel Gibbons, Dayton, Ohio </letterhead>\n\nmoney, no matter how you get it. The good saloonkeeper died and left his wife rich. In due course of events she married a Baptist preacher and the money personally went to a good purpose.\n\nDavis has just read in a Terre Haute paper that President Coolidge dedicated a $2 million memorial for K.C. and that Will Rogers says it looks like a silo. Other people have the right slant on R.A. Long's monument to himself as well as us perverted people who only fought the war behind a gun.\n\nWe passed through a whole,<letterhead>                                                         Hotel Gibbons, Dayton, Ohio </letterhead>\n\nstring of Illinois towns. Evidently they were all good ones too. We stopped awhile in Greenup to see a former supporter of the Old Trails and also stopped in Casey, another nice little town, to see quite a number of former supporters of the movement. They all seemed to be still enthusiastic.\n\nWe ate our noon meal at Brazil, Indiana, at the Hotel Davis. Had a grand lunch for fifty cents. Then we headed for the Hoosier State capitol. Got there about two-thirty and drove around and round the town for thirty minutes trying to find a place,<letterhead> Hotel Gibbons, Dayton, Ohio </letterhead>\n\nto park. They have a fine town, a good-looking state capitol, a federal building, and a courthouse equal to any. The Old Trail runs straight through the town from one side to the other on a big, wide street called Washington. Down in the center of town and <scratched out> about </scratched out> a block north of this street is the Soldiers and Sailors Monument erected to the men who fought in the Civil War. It is a beautiful thing and is in the center of a large circle into which run four streets, <inserted> one </inserted> from,<letterhead> Hotel Gibbons, Dayton, Ohio </letterhead>\n\neach cardinal point. Around the circle are fine hotels, theaters, and clubs. We wanted to see the secretary of the Hoosier Auto Club, whose office is in the English Hotel. It is on this circle. After driving around about a dozen times and out each cross street and <scratched out> down </scratched out> around the block trying to find a place to park, Davis finally got out and I kept going around the circle. Finally I stopped in front of the hotel and the Sec. came out to see me. I told him I'd been around that circle so often I didn't know south from,<letterhead>                                                   Hotel Gibbons, Dayton, Ohio </letterhead>\n\nstraight up. He set me right and we headed for here. Stopped in Richmond, Indiana, at 6:00 P.M. and had as fine a meal as I ever ate and safely arrived here for a woeful disappointment. No letter. This is a fine town, however, from a civic standpoint?good hotels, fine buildings, and apparently lots of business. I hope we have good luck tomorrow, and I hope that letter comes.

He told me he owned a cleaning shop in Borger, Texas, and that he had been making as high as eighty dollars a day running it, but that the Governor of Texas had ruined his business by sending rangers in there and chasing all the girls and gamblers out of town. Claimed he was trying to sell his cleaning,machinery. Told me his name, which I promptly forgot, and asked me mine. I handed him my card and he looked at the Judge on it and said, \"Well I wish I'd been in your court in K.C. yesterday, I'd have had you send me to St. Joe. I began to wonder what I had aboard and he said he was a dope fiend and that he had been since the war, got the habit in the army, and that he was either going to quit or die in the attempt. When I went north to Topeka he got out and went south, said if he went to a big town some uplifter would try to sell him dope or hire him to rob a bank. I told him,<letterhead>                                                                                             Harry S.

I think he was honestly trying to quit.\n\nI saw the big Auburn 8 that those two fellows were killed in at Council Grove. It was some wreck. They were actually driving a hundred miles an hour when they hit. A little too fast. The whole works ought to be exhibited for the benefit of the wreckless drivers' club.\n\nThompson couldn't go after I got there and the Mayor of Council Grove came with me. His name is Young. He owns nine farms, fifteen or twenty business buildings,in Council Grove, a winter home in Florida and spends his time building and running the finest tourist camp in the Country at Council Grove. Just worries his head off if some body at Dodge City or Lyon or some other place on the Old Trails routes a tourist around some way to miss his town. You'd think his life and bread and butter depended on how many groceries he sold in his camp and how many paid customers he had in his park. He's making about $500.00 a month off it. Told me he had to ship 4 carloads of corn out of his grainery to make room for the new crop on just one of the nine farms. He's a very,<letterhead>                                                                                              Harry S.

He has a slide, merry-go-round, monkeys and a dozen other things to entertain touring kids. His park is an elaborate affair.\n\nWe found the roads fine. I drove from Topeka to Council Grove in two hours and then waited around for Mr. Young to get ready until 3 o'clock then drove to Herrington and stayed an hour with Thompson and got here at seven o'clock. It is 68 miles from Topeka to Council Grove and 125 to here so you see the,the roads weren't very bad.\n\nI hope you and your daughter feel fine and that you are having as hot weather as we are. Haven't needed any vest or coat either today.\n\nKiss the baby and tell her to kiss you for me.\nLove to both, Harry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"LYONS. KANS.

Hodges to coffee and toast served by the good looking daughters of the Hodges Bros. They each have one about eighteen. We then made a canvass of the situation and had to wait until 11:45 for the cars from Baldwin to arrive. Got to Baldwin at 1:30 where they gave us lunch and the President of Baker University,told us why we should put the monument on the campus. It is a very remarkable school having been founded in the fifties and was coeducational from its founding. It is one of Kansas' three accredited Universities and has about 600 students. About four hundred couples have married from the University and there is only one divorce, happened last year. Some record I'd say.\n\nWe had supper in Burlingame where we listened to a plea for the monument by a commissioned officer in the Federal army and a man who had been over all the trails seventy years ago. He is 87 years old had all his faculties, and made us,<letterhead>                                                                                             Harry S.

They read us the history of the town showed us the site and then I called you.\n\nWe'll be in Herington at 9:30 at Marion at 11:00 for lunch at McPherson in the afternoon and Lyons to stay all night. We are to get through all right. You should be along. I haven't spent a nickle,and I can't. They won't let me even the phone call was free. Hope I see a letter at Lyons or Dodge or somewhere.

We went down in the salt mine, supposed to be largest in the world.,It is 1,043 feet deep and the finest looking I've seen?nineteen feet thick. The deposit was made some centuries ago by the sea. There are fourteen miles of tunnels and a theater down there. They have mules in the mine that haven't seen daylight in six years. We got some fine samples of salt.\n\nAbout 10 oclock we loaded up for Great Bend and got there with some slipping around at noon. We were highly entertained and then the Dodge City cars didn't come because of rain, so we didn't get here until six oclock. They had prepared a fine midday,<letterhead> \n                                                                                                                                 Santa Fe\n                                                                                                    Eating House and Dining Car System\n                                                                                                                           Fred Harvey Manager\n                                                                                                                                                                            Dodge City, Kansas </letterhead>  \n\nluncheon for us but they took good care of us anyway.

There is a Harvey House at that town but it was full when we arrived but we found a place to stay.\n\nWe stopped in Great Bend and heard that Davis and his party were there. He has a man and woman driving him out and they are getting up ads for a Natl Old Trails Map. We went uptown to find him,and they told us that the party had gone. We drove to Pawnee Rock and stopped and looked around over the country and then went on to Larned but no sign of Davis. We stopped a while and then drove to Kinsley and had lunch from there to Dodge City and called on our friend Mr. Ham Bell who was Mayor of South dodge in the old days; but still no sign of Davis. We then drove to Garden City leaving Dodge about 5 P.M. and arriving in Garden City about 5 P.M. I forgot to change my watch at Dodge so,we drove 35 miles in nothing. We decided to go on to Syracuse and arrived there about 6:30. We stopped at a little town called Lakin to see their camp and there we found Davis. When we couldn't get a place in the Harvey House we went out and stayed with Davis and his gang at the camp.\n\nWe are going to Rocky Ford to the fair this afternoon and then back here and to a meeting tonight. Tomorrow morning our road meeting and then,back home by Monday morning. You should have come. The roads were like boulevards and the weather has been ideal.\n\nTell Marger to be a good young lady.

Arizona put up its claim and I want to tell you it was some job to decide. L.S. Williams from Williams, Arizona, made the best plea I ever listened to, but Williams was like Independence they never had done anything for the National Old Trails.,Springerville, which happens to be the residence of J. W. Becker, national vice president of the N.O.T., has never missed an opportunity to boost the road and pay its money. Davis and I voted for Springerville and Mrs. Moss voted for Williams. Kingman had a little old maid here who was a member of the committee and who was supposed to have an unprejudiced mind but who put forward an argument for Kingman every time a point was made for another town. Her name,<letterhead> \n                                                                                                                      Franciscan\n                                                                                                             Albuquerque, New Mexico                    </letterhead>\n\nwas [illegible] and the man from Williams named her incompetent. She was. She lost her town every opportunity to win.\n\nThe state conference of the D.A.R. for New Mexico is being held here today. They invited Davis and me to their reception this evening and I had to make a speech. Then they had refreshments. An old lady by the name of Joyce got,hold of me and told me her home had been Pleasant Hill some twenty years ago and wanted me to recollect a lot of people who had been dead before I was born.\n\nAfter she got done with me the Albuquerque delegation backed me into a corner and tried to force me to promise to vote for this town for the monument. Then a Santa Fe outfit did me the same way, and then Albuquerque started all over. Santa followed us to the hotel,<letterhead> \n                                                                                                                               Franciscan\n                                                                                                               Albuquerque, New Mexico                    </letterhead>\n\nand wouldn't let us loose and I am writing you at 1:00 a.m. out here. It is 2:00 a.m. at home. I've got to get up at six-thirty, meet Mrs. Moss at seven-thirty, and at 9:00 a.m. hold another court to hear this town, then drive to Santa Fe, sixty-six miles, hear Santa Fe come to a decision, and then start at Trinidad,Colorado, and hear Las Animas and Larimer and decide Colorado and then I'm coming home.\n\nIt will be Thursday before I arrive, but I'd better get this over now than to make another trip. I am crazy to see you and my baby. I don't know how much I love you til I get away for a day or two.\n\nKiss my baby and tell her to kiss her mamma for Daddy.\nLove to you, Harry,<letterhead> \n                                                                                                                Franciscan\n                                                                                                      Albuquerque, New Mexico                    </letterhead>\n\nI was so overjoyed to get your letter at Dodge City that I read it every day. I more than half expected another one here.  It had not come when we left Dodge but after we'd gone about 50 miles the conductor came through the train paging Mr. Truman and handed me the letter.  It had come on that train,and the Sec of the C of C had given it to the conductor, knowing we had gotten on the train.

Everyone was furnished with a horse and went out with Bty A. 9th F.A. for what is known as reconnaissance and occupation of positions. The Bty Commander is usually some Reserve Officer, in this instance Dinwiddie Groves and his detail of officers represent non commissioned officers in the Bty. They ride around and pretend to go to war and learn a lot of stuff that's never used on the front. It's all very pretty and looks fine in print but,it works somewhat differently when the shells are bursting around you sure enough.\n\nI got my raincoat and I am obliged to you, but I'd rather have a bad letter. None has come to date. I'll have to call you if it doesn't come tomorrow. It has cooled off and is very pleasant up here now. The mosquitoes are a fright. I have seven bites on one shoulder.\n\nI hope you and Margie are getting on well and that both of you are behaving nicely.

This has been therefore one successful day. I am getting as brown as an Indian and as tough as Dempsey. I haven't had a headache since I came. It has rained and is cool and probably will rain again tonight. There is nothing wrong except your absence and my inability to tease my daughter.\n\nI appreciate your en,closures, especially the deposit slip. That made your check I gave you good. It was long enough coming. I was afraid it was lost in the mail. The deposit, not the slip. Thanks for the clippings. Everything seems to be going all right in my absence politically. I wish I could see you. I'm glad you missed me at the party. Wish I could have been present. I am taking good care of myself. The colonel is anxious to work and I urge him to do it. I'm having a wonderful time doing a little political maneuvering. Also evening up some scores.,<letterhead>                                                                                       Harry S.

He's made Colonel Elliott's flunky, Captain Fleming, stand on his head right away, which pleased me immensely. You see politics is never absent when I'm around.\n\nBe sure and keep writing. I look for 'em every day.

You sure left me on the uneasy street with that storm close to home, no paper, no letter and not able to phone. I'm glad Miss Margie enjoyed her letter. Yes I got one from the Drug Store Gang. It was written on toilet paper, a whole roll of it, and a different remark on each sheet. It was the hit of the camp.\n\nWe were firing at seven this a.m. The battery was right up close to us. It was like old times sure enough. We  picked the four best problems and let those officers fire in a contest for the Klemm  cup. Col. Seigmund, Salisbury, Col. Leetow, the Nebraska politician,,and myself were the judges. There were two officers from the 380th, two from the 379th. They all fired rotten problems and it was finally Salisbury & Seigmund against Leetow and me or a St. Louis officer against a KC officer. We finally flipped and the St. Louis man won. Naturally that made a lot of goating but they will all finally be satisfied.\n\nMy party was quite a success. The cartoonist from the Star made my place cards and they were cartoons on the shortcomings of each man. We have had a very successful camp. I am all sunburned and have a right hefty mustache, haven't lost any money or spent any except for the dinner Salisbury owes me, $9.00 and The ?? $15.00 so you see I'm doing very well. Kiss my baby and write to your \n\nHarry.\n\nPOSTMARK DATE 7-19-27,Junction City, Kansas\nFt.

One of the lieutenants stuck his finger into the breech mechanism of a 155 howitzer and a piece of it was amputated. Someone looked at the gun trail and noticed this piece of finger lying there and asked who had lost it. Everyone looked to see if he was the guilty party: in the meantime the man to whom it belonged was hotfooting,it across the field toward the hospital. One of the boys picked up the piece and started after him, but in the excitement he lost it and the surgeon over at the hospital found it necessary to graft on a piece of skin, so the invalid won't be permanently injured. He was back on the job in an hour.\n\nWe are going out to fire on Friday morning. That is the only part of the performance I care much for. I am feeling fine and I hope you both are. Bess, you kiss the baby and tell her to kiss you for me.\n\nAlways, Your Harry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"FORT RILEY JUL 12 12 MN 1927 KANS.\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

I guess they are having a fine time. But it's not doing them any more good than my trip is doing me. We fired shell all morning and all yesterday afternoon. It rained so yesterday we couldn't fire in the A.M.  A shellburst is a wicked thing to see. You can't blame people for getting shell shock. It is a very real disease. Some even get it by looking at,the bursts without even getting in reach of them. I can't say I blame them. I went to a reception by Colonel Oliver yesterday afternoon. He's the colonel of the Second Cavalry. I should have had cards but they'll never know the difference. At seven-thirty we had a riding contest between the cavalry, engineers, and artillery. We only got two prizes, third in a walk, trot, and canter class by Colonel Siegmund and second in potato race. The cavalry won first and second in the walk, trot, canter, first in potato race, and third in jump. Engineers won first and second in the jumps. It was a very good exhibition only I'd,<letterhead>                                                                                                      Harry S.

Jozack Miller, Dinwiddie Groves, Crab, and myself are invited to a picnic by a Major Brown over in the post. I'd rather stay home and sleep but I guess I'll have to go. You know how enthusiastic I am about picnics. They are about to leave now and I want to get this mailed so you'll get it. Hope to see you Saturday P.M. if everything holds together. If not,it will be Sunday noon. Kiss the baby and love to you. I want to see you both badly.

We were expecting to come home today but I am outranked. Boxley just came in last night and the manager of the Prairie Pipe Line Co and one of the Skelly's came in and our host won't let us depart until tomorrow, so it will be,Sunday night before we get in. Out host is Mr. Wheatley of the Wheatley Machine works of KC and Tulsa. He has a brother who is a pitcher in the Western League and he is here too. They have a cottage on the Lake. It is 15 miles from Branson by water and ten by road and the road is impassable. Barr is going to Springfield today to see his mother and I am getting him to mail this. I am having a fine time and no expense,and I haven't had a headache since I arrived. Boxley and the ballplayer have gone fishing. The Major and I shot up all the 45 shells without injuring anyone or hitting anything so you won't have to worry about that.\n\nOur phones are all out down here or I'd have called you up. Be sure and kiss the young lady. I sure wish you were both here everything would be right then.\n\nLove to you both from\nYour Harry."

I got a couple of Examiners and a notice that I had a package at the P.O. which Eddie McKim is going to get for me. We were out firing all day today fired some 25 problems and they were fairly successful. I won't get to fire because the officers above the grade of Major are turning over their ammunition to the Lts and Capts because they need it worse than we do. I had the darndest letter from the Drug Store Gang. It was a roll of toilet paper with a note from each one of them on every sheet. There,wasn't a one missing. I sure spent an uneasy Sunday. I tried all day to call you up and couldn't get through. The papers this am were sure a relief. I almost made the trip home because of the tornado. I hope you and the baby are feeling all right. I wish I was home. It seems by the Examiner that Barr is handling the situation in fine shape. Be sure and keep on writing. This has been the longest time away from home of any camp.

I got up very hurriedly shaved and dressed and then found my watch said it was still five minutes until seven. However when we got out on the street all the clocks said eight o'clock, so we were cheated out of an hour's sleep by,by a change in time.\n\nThis town is right on the edge of the Ohio River and looks as if it might fall in any minute. There are high bluffs on the east side, which gives you that impression. We were expected and assigned a room and are to be entertained at lunch and at dinner, so you see we are the distinguished citizens again.\n\nI am enclosing you a horoscope which Davis wanted me to send you. He said you were undoubted due for a splendid outlook,<letterhead>                                                                               Hotel Windsor, \n                                                                                                        Wheeling, W.

Your letter was delivered to me over in the class room by one of the Lts. They all know how I like to get one and when they see one in my box they bring it to me.\n\nWe had one terrific rain storm this morning about 4 o'clock. It came down in sheets. I'd just given a nigger $1.00 to wash my car, yesterday evening. It didn't hurt the wash much but I've got to go out in the mud with it this afternoon. We are going to fire this afternoon whatever,missed this morning. It still looks as if it might come down in sheets again. Barr said in his letter that he was rather dizzy with the road situation and all but he still had his feet on the ground. I guess they have handled everything in fine shape. I see nothing to kick about and it certainly has been a relief to me.\n\nI hope you and the Missy are feeling all right. It was nice of Tucker to accommodate you. I am hoping to get home Sunday A.M. if the roads are passable. They will be if it doesn't rain any more.\n\nBe sure and kiss the baby. Wish I was home now.\nYour Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp : \"JUNCTION CITY KANS. JUL 20 6 PM FT.

I could dictate this letter but I don't like to dictate letters to my honey, even at the risk of being accused of inebriety. This train does not slow up,up for curves, towns or crossing; hence the wobbly writing.\n\nWe are evidently in for a fine meeting at Wheeling. Davis had two telegrams and three letters from the interested parties. The N.O.T. [National Old Trails] is getting bigger every minute even if we did pull a bloomer at Topeka. There's is no alibi for that, we were simply licked.\n\nI hope the baby is all right and you too.

She knows her daddy would take her part if he dared. I was surely glad to get a special this morning. It came while I was out riding. Lt. O'Shea of the 2nd Cavalry took us for a ride up over the reservation. He's a second Lt. West Pointer and a very fine boy. Plays polo and everything.\n\nI saw two polo games yesterday afternoon. One was good but the other was only a punk exhibition. They both went on at the same,time. The fields are alongside of each other and the spectators stand between. Tomorrow we fire in earnest all day long. Also Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday. Fleming isn't making any stars for himself. Everyone here is down on him. He's Elliott's executive officer and supposed to be senior instructor here. I received a pass to the Newman and Royal good for two yesterday. I'm almost afraid to mail it to you for fear it will get lost. Barr seems to be doing fine. I'm sure glad. I hope the cyclone didn't do you any damage. I'm to call you up after a while and see. Please keep on writing. You don't know how good they look.\n\nLove to you from\nYour Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp : \"FORT RILEY KANS.

The National Highway Boosters Association is no more, and the National Old Trails Highway Association is a national organization indeed and in fact. We are completely organized back here and have had our financial situation practically guaranteed. George Washington Lutz, who was the president of the Boosters Association,,is our executive vice president back here and Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio are completely organized with two vice presidents each and a bunch of enthusiastic boosters behind them.\n\nGeorge Washington Lutz is seventy-one years old and is the leading citizen of Wheeling. He looks like George F. Baker, the president of the First National Bank of New York, has mutton-chop whiskers and everything. He's been president of the Board of Trade, the Fair Association, Chamber of Commerce, mayor of Wheeling, and most everything else. He is a widower with no children and has only,<letterhead>                                                                                      Hotel Windsor, \n                                                                                                                 Wheeling, W.

It's what I deserved all right and I am thankful for small favors. I hope you had a good time at Helen's luncheon. She seems to be doing the high social right. I'm very much pleased and flattered that you miss me so. There are two little girls in the other end of this barrack, daughters of a Captain Clayton, who is on duty here. Every time I see them I get so anxious to see you and my daughter I can,hardly stand it. They keep us pretty well occupied here and in times past I'd have thought I was being worked to death but being presiding judge of Jackson County has shown me that there is no limit to a man's ability to stand punishment. When I get in this crowd of soldiers out here and they don't make a grand rush for me and begin pulling me one way and another to get my ear for a road or a contract or the right to sell soap or tacks to the county, I'm rather at a loss. My right arm is almost well and my left is sore from holding a,<letterhead>                                                                                              Harry S.

The Star's Cartoonist is making me some place cards that are screams. He is a young second Loui by the name of Dye. He's pleased to do it because it's getting him out of some other job that he doesn't like so well.\n\nTomorrow we fire the battery and every day next,week we'll do the same. I am one of the Judges to decide who fires the best problem. There will be several prizes besides the K.D. Klemm Cup.\n\nWish you could see a Battery fire once and then you'd appreciate what a powerful weapon of destruction your old man had in the war.\n\nI'm glad it's cooler there. It is here too. You can't say this is a note, can you? I bought Margie a saber today. I guess I'll have to file the end off it to keep her from poking her eye out.

We saw the ones at Carthage and Sarcoxie. The state has some very fine roads down in this country. We were on boulevards nearly all the way. We came by Harrisonville, Butler, Nevada, Carthage, and then south and to Aurora and Branson. At Branson we put up,the cars and took a nice little motorboat for about sixteen miles down the lake to the prettiest little seven-room cottage you ever saw. It was about seven o'clock when we arrived and Hunter and O'Malley proceeded to prepare supper. Mr. Wheatley, to whom the cottage belongs, called up a man who came and finished the cooking. We had to carry all our baggage, groceries, etc. up the hill about two hundred yards to the house. It was quite a job. Hunter and I wheeled up one hundred pounds of ice in a wheel,barrow. Supper was ready about 9:00 p.m. It consisted of fine T-bone steaks, one for each person, O'Brien potatoes, oranges, strawberries, and plenty of other things to go with them, such as bread, coffee, water, etc. Everyone else is in bed and I am writing this on my knee in my room. I am one of three who rank rooms. The rest of them are on cots in the big living room. You don't know how great a relief it is to be loose from that responsibility. I'm not going to think of anyone but you and my,baby and come home without a headache. It is raining to beat the band but they need it down here.\n\nThe lights just went out but the old caretaker lit a lamp for me to finish by. Be sure and kiss my baby and remember I am thinking of you always.\nYour Harry\n\nCall Mrs Barr and tell\nher we are all right.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"BRANSON MAY 19 1927 130 PM MO.\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

I think they are nearly true. Murray had an interview in the Star that,was substantially correct. They are getting what the specifications call for and that would naturally make it more expensive.\n\nI had a horseback ride this morning and a nap before the noon meal and I'm going to a polo game this P.M. and probable a bridge or poker game this evening. There are some extremely highpowered bridge players here. One fellow they call Mr. Work or whoever it was wrote the book.\n\nTomorrow is going to be a dead one. I hate to see it come. I'm almost tempted to come home. Kiss my baby and write as usual.\nYour honey Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp obscured: \"JUNCTION CITY KANS. JUL 16 4 PM FT.

We'll have to arrange it so you can keep it up. I never need any breakfast and if that would keep you from having any more indigestion, for goodness sake let's do it. I'm glad Mrs. Ott is,is satisfied with the court. I am too. I see the said court is functioning. The Star said they had ordered Koehler to pave Fairmount Ave. Had a letter from Vrooman saying the court was not taking any chances on anything but holding all doubtful matters for my return.\n\nI called on the old general out here and asked him to our party next Friday. It's to be a badger fight, so ladies can't come. Eddie McKim is waiting to take this to Junktown so I'll have to make it another note. Be sure and keep writing.

Left Herington at 10:30 and arrived at Marion at 12 o'clock where we had dinner. Marion was having an old settlers picnic and didn't pay us much attention. They turned us over to an old man 87 years old who told us a lot of Indian stories and then we left for McPherson where we had a grand reception by the D.A.R. chapter. They have,a beautiful little city with parks and boulevards, two colleges and a lot of history just like all the rest.\n\nLyons met us at McPherson and they will give us a grand banquet tonight.

Riley. We'd have been about forty minutes earlier but for a nail in the right front tire at Manhattan. It happened right in town and only one block from a garage or we'd have been in a nice fix, for there was no jack in the car. I shall probably unburden my sentiments,to friend Oliver when I return. If he had my job and I his, I'd expect a good going-over under the same circumstances and I'd probably get it.\n\nI am very nicely situated, have a room with a would-be closet and another with a washstand and toilet. It pays to be a lieutenant colonel. I have Eddie McKim in my room at my request. He promoted me a table, a couple of chairs, and a bureau with a mirror, so we shall live in fine style.\n\nThe training program is rather strenuous. I'll pro,<letterhead>                                                                                          Harry S.

They are to fire some 1200 rounds of ammunition and I guess we'll have a fine time doing it.\n\nIt is now 10 P.M. and I've got to arise at 5:45 so you see I've got to get to bed. It's about,104 in the shade up here. I haven't been so hot in four years. It looks as if it might rain, in which case it will be cooler. Went swimming this afternoon with Eddie and Rufus.\n\nKiss my baby and tell her to write me and you do the same.

There was a letter from my two sweethearts. I am hoping it wasn't so hot for the picnic. It came a big rain here early this morning and rained until nine o'clock. We worked just the same right through the rain. It didn't hurt anybody. I went swimming yesterday afternoon in the coldest pool this side of the Arctic. It was plumb full of kids from two years on up. A little girl about the size of Margie made a high dive from the top of the thing where the expert divers show off. You'd undoubtedly have heart failure if you'd seen her.\n\nYes, I am a member of the 443rd Field Artillery. Jay M. Lee has a no-,tion in his head that sounds all right. He wants Mrs. Lee to drive out here a week from Friday and bring you with her. Then you can go home with me Saturday or Sunday. What do you think of it?\n\nTell Marger I will answer her letter this evening. It is nice of her to write me such a fine letter. Be sure you both keep it up. Tell her to kiss her mamma for her daddy. Tell her mamma to return it.\n\nLove to you both by the largest measure you know of.\nYours Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"FORT RILEY JUL 11 4 PM 1928 KANS.\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

At nine o'clock we got on horseback and rode until eleven-thirty. There are copious calls for new skin to be grafted on places where these fat men sit down. The ride was under the direction of a cavalry officer who has, as all cavalrymen have, leather where he sits instead of skin and naturally can't appreciate the tenderness of some,We are to have gun drill and blackboard firing under the direction of the lieutenant colonel this afternoon.\n\nThere was not a letter today.

For some unknown reason there was no letter for me. Do you know that just exactly ten years ago yesterday morning I was placed in command of Battery D, 129 F.A.? I'll never forget that morning as long as I live. Klemm told me the evening before after he's asked me how I'd like to command a battery. I answered him that sometime in the future I hoped to be able to command one. He said, \"You'll take D Bty in the morning at reveille.\" I almost deid of,fright. I was Gates' adjutant so I went back and told him what the Colonel had said and reminded him that \"D\" had had about five in command and would probably have six before another month. He didn't give me much sympathy and I've always thought he probably was at the bottom of it. We finished the war together D and I and I suppose I made more crazy friends, that is the kind who would fight and kill someone for me than I ever will or can again. We are still working in damp weather, but it looks as if the sun may shine later. Kiss my baby and take a car load on credit for yourself. Please write. I do like to get them.\n\nYours Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY JUL 12 1 30PM [1928] FORT RILEY.\">\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

You should have had a letter from me every day because I've never failed to write a note of some kind every day at noon. I even answered Margie's letters; they were so nice and well written I couldn't overlook them. Everybody I showed them to thought I must have a mighty smart four-year-old girl at home.\n\nEddie M.Kim's wife and son and his aunt arrived yesterday afternoon about six o'clock. I had dinner with them down in Junction City last night. His boy is one cute youngster, seven years old. His mother let him stay out here,with Eddie and me last night. He was tickled pink. We moved in another bunk and let him sleep army style. Eddie took him horse back riding today.\n\nWe had one awful rain this morning. I think there must have been at least three inches. It will make the detour beyond Manhattan very nearly impassable for the rest of this day. There was church at seven A.M. breakfast at 7:30 and then we went over for the try out on the men for the horse show next Saturday A.M. The one Mrs. Lee wants you to come with her to see. We had a dozen men to try out in each class; walk, trot and canter class, jumping class and the potato race. We have some very good men.\n\nI have been intending to tell you about Jay Lee's attempt to clutter up the stag party for Friday night. You know it has been customary,<letterhead>                                                                                                            Harry S. Truman\n                                                                                                                                    Independence, Mo.                                       </letterhead>\n\nfor some years for the reserves to have a \"badger fight\" either on Thursday or Friday night of the last week. Well a badger fight is not a very ladylike affair nor is it intended to be one. But it makes a very fitting climax to two weeks of very hard physical labor and it is customary. Jay has tried to get it changed to a dance so he can bring his wife and make a lady affair out of it. He should take his wife to the hotel for dinner that evening and go to a picture show with her if she comes just as I shall do with you if you come and then bring her out here Saturday for the horse show and not interfere with the stag party. I hope you can come and that you will come; we'll manage,to get Eddie sandwiched in so he can come home and I'll see that you enjoy yourself even if you can't see the Badger Fight.\n\nI did not write Myra or call Lee up. She'll probably be mad as a wet hen at me but I'd have been stuck in the mud if I'd gone home and besides I couldn't leave here until noon Saturday and couldn't have been home by six to save my life if the roads had been good.\n\nKiss my baby and take a lot of love for yourself and keep writing. I haven't missed a day in spite of the fact that you've missed <underlined> two </underlined>.\nYours, Harry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"FORT RILEY JUL 16 2 PM 1928 KANS.\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

The air was cool and refreshing and we didn't have to drive hurriedly. This end of the road from St. Mary's to Manhattan was somewhat rough on account of rain a day or two ago and because of detours. They are paving the last gap now and next year will have pavement all the way. The road is open from Manhattan to Riley.\n\nWe have nice quarters with plenty of furniture and all that it takes to make our existence pleasant while here. They had assigned me to a place over the dance hall upstairs but I had it changed to the same barrack that the balance of the regiment is in.,That is the reason it pays to come a day earlier. I'd have probably been uncomfortable all the two weeks if I hadn't got here and made arrangements to suit me yesterday.\n\nI am going over to the hospital for a physical examination and I'll bet you I am 100 percent when I come back, except of course my eyes, which never were any good. I hope you and Margie are having a lot of fun riding around in your new car and that it is giving you entire satisfaction.\n\nI am looking for a letter today.

The medical examination showed perfect except eyes. One of them was nearly blank. The other reasonably good.\n\nI am writing Marger a little letter today. This day being the 13th was all it should have been. We put in the morning riding some ten miles at a trot and then having a regimental problem. The colonel is a wonder. He has brains by the bushel and he knows how to use them. There is one thing though I am sure he is a widower or a bachelor. If he had a wife he would be a more careful dresser. He's no dude. Hyde and I have been by diplomatic,means trying to dress him up. We all appreciate the goating our wives give us when we see someone who hasn't had the proper going over.\n\nOne reason this day was perfect was because it brought me two letters. Well really three because Margaret's was in yours. I am glad you like Fred and I wish I could see him, but I can't. Murray is worth a pair of him to stand behind you. Glad the Lizzie is behaving. Don't fail to write me. I can see a brighter side of life when they come.\n\nKiss Marger and love by the largest measure to you.\nHarry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY JUL 13 9 PM 1928 KANS.\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

They were both mighty fine. I am sorry you are not coming out but I don't think you are making any mistake under the circumstances. This has been quite the hottest day we've had. We went to Manhattan and spent the day studying the long gun and practicing the laying of it by all the methods in the book. It is located on the Campus of the Kansas State Agricultural College and is a very nice place to work.\n\nWe ate in the College Cafeteria and had a wonderful meal for 40 cents. Tomorrow we fire and as usual,I guess I'll have [to] give my ammunition to some second Louie who needs it worse than I do.\n\nThe National Guard arrived yesterday. The is a battery over there commanded by one of my privates and he is a good B.C.\n\nI hope you and Katrina had a wonderful time. I'm glad you got away from her long enough to write me a letter. Keep it up according to count you've only missed one. Eddie is waiting to mail this and I'll have to quit. Love to you in gobs.

That is the only reason you are getting this one because here is another morning without any letter. You'll probably get gipped tomorrow because we go to Manhattan to stay all day and practice on the G.D.F. long gun up there.\n\nWe had a pistol shoot this morning and qualified some twelve officers with that weapon. I wrote Major Barr yesterday and asked him and Vrooman to come out next Friday. If you want to come with them I am sure they would bring you,in the county car. I'd sure like to see you. It is a good thing I did not try to drive home Saturday because those who did go haven't got in yet. I am hoping it will quit raining before next Friday.\n\nHas Margaret been a good girl? I hope she has because if she has she'll be glad if she hasn't she'll be sorry when I get home. Don't miss any more days. Please write. Kiss my baby and a load of love to you.\nYours Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY JUL 17 12 PM 1928 KANS.\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

I'm glad they are at last getting the bond business going. If we carry that, there'll be no stopping us from being a real court. I just had to call you last night.,Maybe my phone bill will be the biggest bill I have, but what do we live for anyway? Money or nothing else matters when you have a real sweetie and a baby.\n\nMrs. Moss and an old maid niece of hers had dinner with us and took us to the Congress, where Secretary Davis was the main speaker. I met the president-general and a whole string of women, from Maine to California-every one of them Mrs. Mark S. Salisbury type, but nice to talk with. We go to a reception for the Missouri delegation tonight. Glad to stop here and go down in town with Dave and Davis. We called on Reed, who was gone, and Capper and Curtis and I left a card for Hawes and George Combs. George was out too. He made,a speech to the women Tuesday night and they all want to adopt him. His speech was to the Missouri women not to the whole Congress. Only Coolidge, the Cabinet, and a county judge from Missouri do that-he-haw.\n\nBe sure and kiss my baby and both of you be good girls until I get home and after too-I'll bring you a stick of gum.\nYour Harry,<circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 8 APR 19 2-PM 1928\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

If I inadvertently implied that it was a task, the implication was not intended. It is a pleasant duty, as you by this time ought to know. I am the only person here who has written his wife or sweetie as many as two a week and because I write every day it is a cause for comment. It is also a cause for comment that I don't go to picnics or dances or any of the other feminine entertainment, but as you ought to know I didn't come out here for but one thing and that is mental,relaxation and physical employment. I have gotten both. We have a physical instructor who has loosened every muscle I have and artillery has kept my mind so busy that I haven't had time to think of court or have a headache. There is only one thing that would make the vacation complete and that would be to have you along. It is the most satisfactory vacation to me except for your absence, both from a financial and a physical standpoint, that I could have. I had two letters today as I had hoped I would have. There was also a nice one from my girl. By the way, you didn't mention her in either one. I have written her two letters of her own which,you didn't say had arrived. The mail service is rotten. There never has been a day that one wasn't mailed to you, and then two to daughter besides.\n\nI have been grading officers on firing all day today and yesterday and I got to fire a real shrapnel problem myself. Never expected it but this colonel is a peach. Quite the smartest man I've been under. The doctor is going to take these to Junction City. So kiss Margie and tell her to kiss her mamma for\nDaddy"

We are only a half-day's march by auto from the Capital anyway and we can get more rest by doing that.\n\nMr. Lutz came down to the hotel this morning and went over to Washington, Pennsylvania, with us where we met one of our vice presidents for Pennsylvania and had a meeting with him and the Chamber of Commerce and the president of the country club, McGinnis by name, and tried to settle the monument lo-,<letterhead>                                                                                                    Ft.

Then we went on to Uniontown to a Rotary Club meeting, after which we met the president of the Chamber of Commerce and the manager of the Motor Club and found out that Washington and Uniontown are at swords' points because the former got the monument. They've even brought in the governor and the state auto commission. They're worse than Kentucky mountaineers. Same here in Maryland. But Davis and I are going to straighten them out I believe if we can get the feminine part of the row satisfied.

Riley, Kans.  July 14, '28\n\nDear Bess and Marger:\n\nThis is another day that is not so bright. I had no letter from you today. Something must be wrong. It is going to rain very soon. Eddie McKim, Hyde and I were swimming. It was cold as Sam Hill because the sun was under a cloud.\n\nWe went out on a road march this morning down to three mile creek, made the Lts and Captains ride the horses and unhitch and unharness and put up a picket line. It was right interesting to watch some of these city men try to take off the harness and then attempt to put it on hind part before maybe.\n\nThe Col. Jay Lee and a Major Jones,from Omaha took a cross country ride from nine to ten thirty. It is a very sorrowful bunch of horseback riders today. Most of them are complaining of sore seats etc ad lib. You'd be surprised at yours truly. <underlined> I am not sore </underlined> anywhere and I haven't missed a ride or a trot.\n\nVivian and Gilbert Strode were up to see me yesterday about Washington Twp. I tried to tell them what to do. Wish I'd come home over the weekend but I was afraid it might rain and I couldn't get back. Kiss my baby, and take a load of love for Miss Bessie.\n\nYours Harry.,<circular postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY JUL 15 4 PM 1928 KANS.\"; 2 cents United States Postage>\n\n\n\n                                                             Mrs Harry S.

My hands and neck are as red [as] a barn door. But I can stand it. There was no chance to write today at noon because we had our lunch brought out to us in a cart. I had to dress up in my thick shirt and act as President of an Army Court. We had a lot of fun trying an officer but it was right hot while we did it.\n\nWell there are only three days more and then I can see my wife and baby and I,hope I never go again unless you can go with me. It is hotter than the inside of a stove here but I don't mind it. I'm as brown as a bear and as strong as an ox. I can go for another year and a half.\n\nKiss my baby and tell her to kiss her mamma.\n\nLoads of love.

I am glad that the baby had a good time at the park and the flying field. I want her to do every thing and have every thing and still have that most people have to work to live, and I don't want her to be a high hat.\n\n       I took my field glasses to the ordinance officer of the 128th F. A. and had them cleaned.  They are just as good as the day I bought them now and I wouldn't trade them for a new pair because of the sentimental attachment.  Maybe you don't know it,but I guess I am two thirds damn fool and the other third sentimentalist.  Whenever I see a yellow headed little girl I want to pick her up and squeeze her, when I meet a member of my battery I don't care how oreny and good for nothing he is he can have whatever I've got and when I think of school days I always thing of a pretty little girl with curls down her back who grew into the best and sweetest sweetheart a man ever had and I wish I could see her now.  Kiss my baby and look for me some time Saturday I hope; will phone you if I am later.\n                                                 Your good for nothing but \n                                                       loving husband \n                                                                Harry.,[postmark, stamp: \"KANS.

I am still drawing a little but no blood. Walked about a mile today without any serious results at all.  You asked about McKim.  All the family are all right but he said his boy is getting hard to handle.  They all had scarlet fever last winter.  Jay Lee didn't arrive. Why, I don't know.\n\n       We went out on a problem this morning.  The [scratched out] cal [/scratched out] cavalry and artillery here on the post put on a problem and it was very interesting. The engineers shot off some TNT and,the cavalry made a charge over the hill.  The artillery shot some blanks.  It all looked fine to a person who has never seen a war. It was tame to those of who who were in the Argonne, St. Micheil and and Verdun.  We had a lot of fun any way.  Wish you and my baby were here.  Every time I see a little girl I want to kiss her but I don't like the look of the army women.  They had a dance last night but I played cards in my own billet.  Keep on writing I'll be perfect as to health when I get home.  Kiss my girl twice and tell her to kiss her mama for her daddy.

Got up at a quarter of six and had breakfast at seven.  Some of the boys went over to ride after 6 A.M.  I didn't go.  There was church in the Godfrey Court dance hall at 6:30 A.M. where they had a dance last night.  The opened with \"Onward Christian Soldiers\" and I wanted to see my girl so badly that I wanted to come home at once. If I could get a plane I would.\n\n        Yesterday was a day of accidents for our organization.  Rufus Burrus sprained his ankle and a Lt. by the name of Carruthers ran into,a car at Manhattan on his way home to Topeka and wrecked himself and his car both.  He is in the hospital here and it will take a week to fix the car.  I think I told you yesterday that I walked a mile and climbed the highest hill on the reservation without serious results.  I am eating like horse, sleeping well and getting sunburned in good shape. If I had you and Margaret here today I'd be completely happy.  Be sure and keep writing. The letters have come every day and so have the papers. Got the Digest and appreciate it a lot.  Kiss Margaret and tell her to be a good young lady.\n\n         Lots of love to you both\n\n                           Harry."

We went out to the firing point at 7 A.M. and stayed there until four o'clock, having our lunches sent out. It has been my custom every morning after breakfast to write you a letter while the rest are out riding.  I couldn't do it today.  Every day at noon I get your letter.  When I went to [scratched out] lunch [/scratched out] [inserted] dinner [/inserted] tonight I saw only the Examiner and Miss Margie's letter but none from you.  I didn't enjoy the meal a bit but felt as if the day had been a complete failure.  I made,up my mind that the mail orderly had put it in the wrong box so I took another look in the adjoining box and there it was.  If I'd missed two days in succession there'd have been [war?] really.\n\n         We went out on the hill and I sat in the sun and [fired?] the officers of the regiment.  My hands are as [scratched out] real [/scratched out] red as beets and my neck and face are full of violet rays.  I am fit but still having some drainage.\n\n         Will see you [scratched out] St [/scratched out] Saturday or Sunday and I am sure I'll be very fit when I arrive. Had a letter from Mary and she says mamma is better.  That makes me feel better.  I worry about her a lot.  Don't miss any more days please\n\n                                                  Love to you & Margaret\n                                                              Harry.,[printed]                                                                                     [postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY KANS.

He also told me that I'd never need another typhoid inoculation.\n\n         McKim has gone to play golf, and all the gang are at the hospital being examined.  It is so still around here it hurts your ears.  I've made arrangements not to ride horse back so don't worry.\n\n         I came away without my slippers at last but I can use my low cuts instead so you needn't mail them.  If anything worth while shows up in the Examiner, please mail it.

I thought that you and Margaret might want to come and see me while I am out here was the only reason I asked you if you could come, and as to finance that would have been my problem and I'd have solved it.  But maybe we'll have better luck next time.  My physical condition is almost perfect I think another ten days and it will be.\n\n       The county farm seems to have made a name for itself while I'm gone and Mr. Bash seems to head the column. I wonder what Barr was doing? He never knows when to grab off the lead.,I guess I'll have to phone him and tell him something about this case.  These people sent this old man out there over my protest alleging that he was not in his right mind and that they could not care for him at home.  It seems to be different now.  Please keep on writing and let me know how the reaction is.\n\n       I get the Star and Times and have recieved two Examiners by mail so I guess they are sending it.\n\n       I hope Margie has been a good girl and that she'll tell me when I get home that she has minded her mother and never cried a bit while I'm gone. Lots of love to you and kiss my baby\n                                                                                                               Your\n                                                                                                                Harry"

Sure glad to get it too. It rained all night last night and most [inserted] of [/inserted] yesterday.  Nearly all the outfit went out without raincoats and nearly drowned. I went in the car and so didn't get wet.  The rest of them have gone on a demonstration this A.M. but it is so muddy out where they are going that I'll have to stay in.  They are to have a cavalry and artillery demonstration, using regulars.  National Guards,and Reserves all together.  It ought to be a fine war the way it is raining.  I had a year of that sort of war under real conditions so I guess I'm not missing very much.  We are having a very pleasant and instructive camp.  This Colonel we have is as well informed on all subjects as some I've had are ignorant.  There's only one thing wrong with him. He won't dress the part. If we could get him dressed up there'd be no equal to him.  All of us have some screw loose, I guess. I hope baby is well and happy and I'm awfully pleased you called Mamma. Please do it once in while.  Kiss my girl and tell her to be good. Your Harry."

It sure made the day brighter. The card was from a Jewish attorney who is a friend of Vrooman's and Metzger's.  I am sorry that the young lady didn't get to tell me good bye but I thought she needed the sleep more than she needed to tell me goodbye.  Arrowsmith was supposed to be at this camp and he ought to have known I was gone.  He is getting anxious to finish up so he can get,paid I guess.  We are going out on a terrain problem this A.M. I am going mounted in the car the rest go horse back. My health and nerves are getting as good as ever.  The weather has been ideal and everyone sleeps like a log.  The worst thing is to get up at 5:30 in morning.  Everyone is good to me and I am having the usual pleasant and instructive time.  I'll write you a better one tomorrow.  Maybe I'll have another letter.  Love to you both from your\n \n            Harry"

I am still in good shape physically - walked up another hill without stopping and I am as brown as an Indian.  The Battery went for a road march this A.M. and I went in an automobile.  I went up to the National Guard firing point and saw my private who is now a Battery Commander and a good one.  They were doing some good firing. Condon then brought in and I inspected his kitchen. It was sure clean.  His wife said she'd never invite an army officer to dinner.\n\n           I am going down there to dinner tonight at 6 o'clock.  This has been a good,vacation for me and I think I'll be as good as new when I get home. Mr. Southern has diagnosed my associate correctly.  They have never been three like the three I've had to deal with.  They are in a class by themselves. If I can win in spite of them there ought to be more credit for it.  Keep on writing and be sure and kiss my baby and tell her to kiss her mamma for me.\n\n           I am more than glad you heard from mamma.\n\n                                          Love and lots of it.\n\n                                                     Yours\n                                                       Harry"

If I remember correctly I phoned when I arrived (after a four mile trip) and I phoned you Saturday night, (under like circumstances.) and just because I don't raise sand and have spasms doesn't mean that I never worry about you or that I wouldn't highly appreciate a phone call -- especially tonight. I haven't been so homesick since I went to France. It was almost a tragedy when you left.

The pin headed postmaster on this Post would be holding them until the camp is over I guess if I hadn't just made him give them up.  We managed to get organized after a fashion today.  I have three majors, three captains two 1st and twenty second Lts. A very nice outfit and I believe I'm to have a real camp.\n\n       Did you have any rain?  It sprinkled here last night and once or twice today. It has been very pleasant all day. If you decide to come you'd better phone,me instead of wiring because a wire might not get me until two days after you arrived.  I am now living in 4A Godfrey Court and you can get me by calling Ft Riley and asking for that address.\n\n       I am sorry my baby hurt her knees and I hope they both are well by now.  I am wondering if she's had to go to bed any more.\n\n       Be sure and keep writing. I've got to go and make up a lot of problems for tomorrow in order to keep this gang busy.  Kiss my baby and tell her to kiss her mamma for daddy.\n\n                                                                          Love to you both\n                                                                                   Harry\n\nThis phone is\nFt Riley 339.,[printed]                                        [postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY KANS.

It was hot and we'd fired from 7:30 until 1:30 and then examined a lot of officers on instruments and then came in and went to sleep. Today we finished up the firing with shrapnel and tomorrow we'll examine the balance and tomorrow night the regimental dinner, go riding Friday and the war will be over.  I'll be very glad to get home and take on the troubles of Jackson County until fall.  I suppose the gang will have spent all the available funds,by the time I arrive it will be my job to find the funds to opperate until fall elections are over.\n\n        Got a good letter today and was mighty glad to have it.

The wind came from the northeast this morning about ten oclock and it is very cool and pleasant.  The sun came down in all its power this morning however. I wish you'd stayed but I guess it is more pleasant for you at home and I shouldn't be so selfish.\n\n       We fire tomorrow morning and the next day too. My army is improving wonderfully and I expect them to go away better equipped as national defenders than when they came.  I hope you and my daughter,had a pleasant trip home. You no doubt got very warm because it was hot in the barrack and it has to be extra hot for that to happen.\n\n       I hope I get some soft of word tomorrow. I got one Examiner. If you see any thing else worth publishing send it to me.\n\n                                                           Your loving\n                                                               Harry.,[postmark, stamp: \"KANS.

They insisted on vaccinating me for smallpox and I dropped and broke my reading glasses, a wonderful start off.  Colonel Williams who commands the 128th Field Artillery had me down there for dinner.  You know one of the batteries is commanded by one of my former privates. It was a very pleasant meal and I enjoyed it.  We went swimming this afternoon again and they had changed the water.  It was about as cold as the Antarctic Ocean.\n\n        I am having an officers meeting,to let them know who's boss and to get started right.

Yesterday afternoon about 7:15 we stuck a wire fence staple into one of our tires just east of Manhattan and had to get out and get under. The first time I've changed a tire in a long time.  It was just about such a place as the one where we stuck the [scratched out] stake into the same tire.\n\n          The party was in full swing when we arrived and was a grand success.  There were a great many candidates to pull the badger; and the Engineers tried,to give me a lesson in probabilities at five cents ante and a quarter limit. I made them pay me at the rate of about a dollar and a half an hour for the time of the session.\n\n          At the horse show this morning Eddie McKim's horse failed to take one of the barriers and both horse and Eddie did a wonderful Prince of Wales. He sprained his elbow and was wondering if he could make his wife believe he had fallen out of bed or some thing.\n\n           I wonder if my girl has had to go to bed again because she can't behave herself.  I sure hope she hasn't because I want her to be as good as she's nice looking.\n\n           I hope you are both enjoying the heat as well as I am. Write me as often as you'd have me do it and kiss my baby if she's good.  Your boy friend and sweetheart.\n\n                                                              Harry,[printed]                                        [postmark, stamp: \"JUNCTION CITY KANS.

I came aboard Saturday at 9: A.M. and have been playing sailor ever since. They surely have a soft life except when they coal ship which they did this morning. They battoned down the hatches closed the port holes put us all in overall and then poured on,the coal from a big crane with a clam shell shovel on the end of it. It was a nice coal dusty job.

Slept all right last night got up for breakfast and then slept until noon and then until three o'clock. Then went swimming.  There was a little girl over there about one and a half years old who insisted in staying under the ice cold shower and she'd yell her head off if she wasn't allowed to do it.\n\n         I suppose you are roasting. The wind out here is hot but I'm not suffering with the heat. Hyde,and I are very nicely situated with a barrack all to ourselves It will be full I guess by tomorrow noon. I wish you were here with me. It would be a most satisfactory situation if you were.  I am looking forward to your comming down so down disappoint me.\n\n        There's a train leaves at 10:40 and gets here at 2 PM and one leaves at 6:15 PM arriving here at nine o'clock which I believe is the best one to come on. How is my girl behaving? I hope she good and well and that you are enjoying the heat.  Your letter hasn't come yet - but I may get it at supper. Tell Margaret to kiss her mother for daddy.

You say it has been a week from Sunday to Thursday I say it's been a month and getting a week longer every day.  I overslept this morning which kept it from being great so long.  I usually get up at 5:30 and beat everyone to the shower and shaving trough; today I didn't arise until the whistle blew.  I have three majors whom I have to keep busy and it makes my head go around to do it.  They are smart and well informed men. I have them studying now on an order for tomorrow but tomorrow I'll have to give them another,for the next day.\n\n             If we have another war I am going to arrange to take my honey and baby along.  It is a wonderful thing how absolutely dependent a man can become.  I don't see how I got along until I was thirty four without you. Just think of all the [underlined] wasted [/underlined] years that could have been pleasantly and profitably spent.  I might even have been a financial success if I'd started with you sooner.\n\n             Went out and watched my former buck private fire his battery.  He's a good battery commander in the 128th F.A. Mo. Nat. Guard. He writes his wife every day too. You see I even trained them right in every respect.

He has been the office navigator for the whole trip.\n\n        On Thursday evening the ward room officer returned the Captain's courtesy of Tuesday and had him to dinner with us. They pinned service stripes on Barr & myself and then went up on deck where they had prize fights and wrestling matches by the crew for our entertainment. I had to make a speech as well as the Captain & Barr.\n\n        They have had a lot of fun teaching me naval terms for kitchen, dining room, deck etc. I wish you & my baby were going to meet [scratched out] us [/scratched out] [inserted] me [/inserted] at Chicago.

Yesterday was about the worlds worst. I had an accommodation spasm altho way down here beside a headache and Halvoson. The Court room was impassable and every pest in the County was there including Lester and Stayton. I am just about to blow up and another [fellow?] is turned into the balloon, (and its really the only puff that can count.). So I went out to camp hunted up a friend took two snorts and went to bed. This morning I felt better, took the outfit out horseback and road them fifteen miles more or less over a terrain problem. I was in command of all the artillery. It was a success so I guess my head, eye and,pests had cleared up.\n\n      You tell my daughter that the next time you choose to spoil two days in succession, for her please to remedy the situation. I hope you're both had a good day and lots of fun. If you don't send me a letter tomorrow I'll neither write or call you until Sunday morning.\n\n                                   Love to you both\n                                         Your Dad.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"MANHATTAN KANS.

You are very popular with the 2nd Louis because they all know when I get a letter I'm not so cranky. I gave them hell this morning in the firing school and when Rufus brought me a letter the remark was,well it'll be easy this afternoon he got a letter.\n\n        It rained nearly all night and was cold as October this morning but has warmed up by now. It never gets muddy the ground is sandy and is easier to walk on and rive over when it is wet then when dry.\n\n        Col Randolf was here yesterday and we took him to the train last night.\n\n        The Camp is all organized and going good. The food is good and every one is having to do,what he ought. Burrus is around today and feeling all right.\n\n        Tell my daughter I'm still looking for that letter.\n\n        Keep writing. Tell Margaret to kiss her mamma for Dad. I am always\n\n                                                       Yours\n                                                          Harry."

I don't know where Rufus has his wife parked but its somewhere up the road. He brought his sister and someone else. They haven't seen much of him because he has been sick in camp two days. These young kids can't stand the physical and mental inconvenience that the old heads take as a matter of course. I often wonder how many of them could go through a Meuse-Argonne or Camp Doniphan training and still be whole. They all live in a machine conscience age and when the machine doesn't function for them they are out of luck.\n\n      I hope that my beautiful daughter is still doing her finger exercises and practicing as she ought. The day is very pleasant not hot or cold. Yesterday it went to 97 while I was tramping all over 600 acres,trying to put seventeen car loads of tractors and trucks into position as a regiment of 155s. I got it done after a fashion but got a skinning for not doing it some other way. The Nebraska Colonel who is Rep candidate for Governor went out this morning after I'd made all the mistakes in the book before him and made as many as I did. So I don't feel so badly.\n\n      I hope you are all well and happy as I am. I'm brown as an Indian eating like a horse and sleeping seven hours a night. Keep writing ever if it [scratched out] does get hot.\n\n      Kiss Margaret. I had hoped for a letter from her.\n\n                   Your Loving\n                             Harry.,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"LITTLE FALLS MINN.

Thanks for sending Norquist's letter. I'll write him. I sure hope Frank gets along all right. That must be a very painful condition. What on earth could have caused it?\n\n       We went out to fire this morning and I was disappointed in the showing and told them that I wanted a little less poker playing and a little more skull practice. I don't know what they thought of it but I have never seen such a dull display at a firing point. Only three out of eleven showed any signs of knowing what it was about.\n\n       We are going to fire 155 this afternoon. We were firing 37mn mounted on the big gun this morning.  Tomorrow we go back and fire the real gun,75's. I can't seem to hook up with tractors some way and all the men are the same way. I sure wish I had you and Margaret up here but so far as heat is concerned its been just as hot up here as down there. The nights have been cool but it sure gets hot in the day time.\n\n        Please keep writing to me.  I am getting cranky and they help keep me right.\n\n        Love to my daughter but I thought maybe she'd surely write me\n\n                                     Love to you both lots of it.\n                                                    Harry.,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"LITTLE FALLS MINN.

The razor blades were in the package too. That is all I've missed so far. We have organized the regiment and are preparing to start work in earnest tomorrow morning. Col Dwight P. Griswold the Rep nominee for Governor of Nebraska and his men are with my out fit for training. He will command all one day and I the next. Heis a fine man and my good friend but he can't be elected Gov because Bryan can't be beaten and conditions are against him. He doesn't seem to be worried about it.\n\n            Speaking of Omaha [liquor?] I arrived there at 9 A.M. and Eddie and I left at 9:30, arrived in Mason City at 4:30 P.M. and I haven't seen any Omaha [booze?] yet. The strongest thing we have hear in camp is Minneapolis near beer about like we have at home except for,contraband brought in by people who came from other states.\n\n            The regulars in charge of this camp are all friends of mine and I am sure every thing will be fine. Col. Jackman from Minneapolis is here in charge of an out fit. You know he commanded the 443rd a couple of years while I was Lt. Col. and let me run it. He was very glad to see us all.\n\n            I am hoping that Margaret is practicing and walking more every day. I make it pleasant for both of you when I get home. I nearly froze last night, but the wind is in the south today and some what warmer. I wore my khaki yesterday but have on wool today.\n\n            We are going to Brainard this afternoon and I'll mail this from there. Please send me the news and keep writing. Tell Margaret to give you a big kiss and you return it. Your loving dad and sweety   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Harry.\n\nThe gang call it Camp \"Believe It or Not.\",[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"LITTLE FALLS MINN.

I forgot to tell you why i you a collect telegram when I arrived. It was because I had to phone it in to Little Falls nine miles away and that was the only way they'd take it unless I came in and paid for it and I was plenty tired and so sent it C.O.D.\n\n          We have been holding school this morning and trying to get ready to take out four batteries of 155 howitzers. They are operated with tractors and it takes lots of information to make them operate. I have Snyder and Ted and McKim all working their heads off to help me make a good showing. In fact all the people under me seem,to be anxious for the new Colonel to make a showing and I'll have to work hard and do it.\n\n          It's hot today and the wind is blowing a gale and sand is in the air. It wasn't so cold last [scratched out] year [/scratched out] night and it may even be hot tonight.\n\n          I went to Brainard yesterday afternoon and sent my daughter a post card. Hope she got it. Please call mamma and see how she [scratched out] is getting on. The wind is blowing so that I can hardly write. I am sitting at a little wooden table out in front of the tent just as you've seen pictures of soldiers doing.\n\n          Please write as often as you can I am getting fat and sun burned.\n\n                           Your loving [illegible] and dad\n\n                                       Harry S Truman,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"LITTLE FALLS MINN.

It also stands for [illegible] of my Heart; so what other could equal such a salutation as that!\n\n      I am in bed at home, have seen Frank, Natalie and George. Had dinner with your mother, who by the way seemed really glad to see me, and Fred. [Illegible] showed all her teeth when I told her Margaret missed her and was sending  her a card. She's going to the Post Office tomorrow to see if there is one.\n\n      Frank is still in a turmoil over the Mill, however he thinks that there [inserted in right margin]  Fred says he sent another letter to the Colonial You'd better ask for it.,is now a chance of his voting your mothers stock independently of the others in which case he can go in with Arch Wagner and handle the situation. Old man Dunn has agreed to resign. Frank has had a conference with the Wells and with Henry Jost and he seems to think he has the situation in hand.\n\n      George looks much better and if we can keep him down another week he'll be cured. He promised me not to try to get up until Monday and I'll get a further delay then I think. He was pleased with the candy and said he would give Frank & Fred a piece of it. Your mother looks fine and so does Fred.\n\n      I have talked to T. J. and to Jim over the 'phone. T. J. is much better and gave,[letterhead]                                                                                           Harry S.

[/letterhead]\n\nme to understand that I could do as I pleased with the County. I am to see him Monday morning. Will see Jim tomorrow.\n\n      Lou Holland called me and told me that he is being considered for Comptroller of the Currency, which is the biggest job under the Sec. of the Treasury and wanted me to get Mr. Pendergast to endorse him. Mr. P. told me to write my own ticket and make the endorsement as strong as Lou wanted it.\n\n      McElroy with his usual fine Italian Hand has been trying to put me into a bad political position over the action of the State Board on assessment. He has reduced his assessment 5% and has cut the rate somewhat but I'll still make him like it before the show,is over. As long as the Big Boss believes in me I don't care what the others do and McElroy will be kissing me before the month is out.\n\n     I feel so much better about our daughter that it is almost as if a hundred pound weight has been lifted from my head. Make her follow sun and diet as she should and by the time I come back down there she ought to be as big and beautiful as her mamma. The weather has been terrible up here, snowed all day yesterday and rained today. The wind in the north and very cold. Paper says clear tomorrow. Hope you all have a good time and don't worry about anything up here. Everyone is [underlined] all [/underlined] right.

[/letterhead]  Sunday 4/30/33\n\nMy Dear Bess:-\n\n        I suppose you'll miss a day on getting letters. But I haven't missed sending one every day and on some days two. I paid my bill at Sands yesterday and he sent you a beautiful plant. I gave it to your mother. She seemed very much pleased with it. I just talked to her over the phone. I am at the farm, have been all day, and shall stay all night.\n\n        Well Easter is still working. In spite of wind and rain and hail yesterday and last night today is a fine day. I hope you are having fine weather, and that there are no more sore throats and I [scratched out] also hope that the water and the,other things will become more satisfactory to Miss K. However most of us are disgusted with a lot of things we never [underlined] talk [/underlined] about and other people are not bored. If my dear old mother has any fault and I don't agree that she has any it is an inability to keep her personal likes and dislikes from the world at large. But I pay not attention to it and I know that in nine cases out of ten she is only suffering from a passing whim.\n\n         I shall have a great deal to tell you about the two jobs I'm to choose from when I see you. There are excellent reasons for talking either and the same kind for take neither so we'll decide it later. I am going to finish one before before I cross another bridge. Please keep writing and tell my baby I hope she hasn't a sore finger or a paralyzed arm or anything. Give her a kiss.

There was no letter from you. We had the usual court session and the papers tried to start a row between me and the Sheriff. I don't want to start any row but I am going to finish one. He is out on a limb, and I am going to saw it off a little at a time. They are looking all over town for me now, but I told Tom Bourke to tell no one where,[letterhead]                                                                   Hotel Baltimore\n                                                                                       Kansas City, Mo. [/letterhead]\n\nI am and he won't. This evening I am going to dinner with a Colonel from Omaha who is giving the final lecture here and then I'm going to the farm and stay all night.

[/letterhead]\tWed  May 3, 1933.\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n      I wrote you and Margaret last night but I saw Anna Jackson on my way to Court this morning and told her that I'd gotten a letter from you about Natalie. It was a quarter after seven and she was out raking trash in the back yard. She was very much pleased and said she hoped we could stay for commencement. I hope we can too.\n\n      It is winter time up here again and has been since Sunday. Had it been clear last night ther'd have been frost sure. It has been cold and cloudy since Sunday although Sunday was a fine clear day.,The sheriff has kicked over the traces now and closed the Independence jail. He thinks he'll criple the road work. I'm not sorry he closed the jail because we don't need two and it will give me an excuse to cut some more expense. He has a Hoover head (the sheriff) and Horse Doc Johnson for an advisor. It's a real combination. You can remember what a time I had with him in the Court. But he'll come around. \n\n      I'm getting things all sett and the papers are giving me a better break now. Things will work around right. Be sure and [underlined] watch [/underlined] the baby. I'll be down just as soon as I can get there but I must put things in shape so I can't be rolled before I leave. \n\n      Keep on writing. It's a real day when I get a letter and I haven't missed for some time. Kiss my girl and tell her I hope her arm [written in right margin] is well enough to write.

I got a letter. Even if it was short I got one. You said I write letters that are no good, well you don't say much in yours. But I'm glad to get them even if there were only an enveloope with an address to me, written by you. I am in bed in my old room at the farm, and I can remember how I used to lie up here and wait for a letter from you, and then read the old one. Those were the days -- why didn't you marry me when I first asked you? I don't know, do you?\n\n        Mr. Bill Southern is my friend all right but he'd like to make me quit politics in a blaze of fire and brimstone. I don't want to quit that way. Gov. Park made a speech,in which he told McElroy - not me, that his [inserted] Park's [/inserted] budget bill for counties would cure Jackson County's not going into the red. The dear Gov's County Budget bill is an extract from my County Reorganization Bill - just one of the features of it. McElroy has evidently told Park that I am a very extravagant official and need checking. Well anyway the budget bill is half what I want and I'm not a partner to any rackets. The Star is making a goat of me - not a Pendergast goat either but a tax goat. I'll lick the whole gang yet and make 'em like it.\n\n       Went to the Equilization Board and saw Judge McCardle. He said if he'd known we were going to Jackson he'd have given us letters to the finest people in town. I subscribed to the Star for you today and the Examiner. Told your Mother that you'd write what you wanted shipped to her,[letterhead]                                                               Harry S. Truman\n                                                                              Independence, Mo. [/letterhead]  \n\nand I would ship it. She's looking for the letter from you to tell her. I'll send you the cot Monday.\n\n       It cleared up today and looks as if we'd have a fine Easter, but its cold as can be - wind's in the north and whistling into my north window like January. Hope you are all happy and doing fine. I'm glad the brakes were easily fixt. I've worried about that considerably.\n\n       Tell Kicky and Margaret to be good little girls and I'll bring them something nice when I come for them. Be nice and write me as often as you feel inclined.\n\n                                                             Your lonesome,\n                                                                       Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"INDEPENDENCE MO APR 16 3 30 PM 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\n\n                                                              Mrs. Harry S.

[/letterhead]              Thursday May 4,\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n       I got two letters today and it made things a lot brighter although I am uneasy about the Kinaman woman's leaving. I wonder what she expected anyway, but you always bet that you get what you pay for -- no more, no less; and when you pay nothing you get nothing. She evidently thought she was confering a favor on us by being along, but I'd feel a lot easier if someone was with you. I had a good dinner last night with Col. Gibson and about twenty other reserve officers at the Baltimore and then went out to Kirby's house and played poker until midnight, went back to the Baltimore and stayed all night and got to Boxley's office at eight this morning after paying your Woolf Bros. bill Discussed the tall hatted Sheriff and,I think got him put where he belongs. Saw Judge Goodrich who wanted to open the bank situation again which I refused to do. Went over to the Architects and have spent the rest of the day. We went over the plans from start to finish, examined the model and I think things are in fine shape to put over big next Wednesday. We'll advertise the bonds Monday, and advertise for bids on the building May 15th and I'll try to leave for St Louis Monday night, be in St Louis Tuesday and should get to Gulfport Wednesday or Thursday of the week of the fifteenth. If you get scared go to the Markhorn and stay till I come and then we'll go back to the house. If I leave here now we'll never build this Court House and my budget will blow higher than a kite. Wire me if everything isn't right and I'll come right down.

We had a grand dinner. Frank had to come up to the election office so I came with him and am at the office writing this. Then I have to prepare some Court orders, go to a Legion meeting and then home to bed and get up and put in another day with the Architects. I may go to the Lake of the Ozarks Saturday with Boxley and stay over Sunday with Doc Luzier. Mr. Neild will go if he can stay over. It looks as if I am going to get,everything in some sort of shape before long and I'll still be on top. I can't help but worry about you and I will come down just the minute I can let loose.\n\n        Anna had a fine letter from Natalie who evidently enjoyed herself immensely Sunday. She was very much surprized at Margaret's political mind. Miss Chiles spent the day with your mother and read Natalie's letter and she thought it remarkable that the young lady should be interested in politics. I don't. There'd be something wrong if she weren't.\n\n        Please be careful, if I don't here from you regularly you'll get a two dollar collect telegram and a charge phone call. When I didn't get a letter yesterday your mother nearly stewed her head off and wanted to send a wire. Be as good as you can and don't spank the baby too much. Lots of love.

[/letterhead] Sunday May 7, 1933\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n      This has been a very dull Sunday. I came up here last night to a Legion affair and stayed all night and I'm still here at noon. It was a good party but I had to leave it. As usual they got too rough and I'm still in politics. I was supposed to go to the Lake of the Ozarks yesterday with Neild, Boxley and Luzier, but Neild had to go home so that party was called off. I went out to the farm and had dinner and the phone began its usual tattoo and I came up here. I'll leave for the farm in a few minutes because the room at home had wet paint on the floor.\n\nTomorrow I'll be forty nine and for all,the good I've done the forty might as well be left off. Take it all together though the experience has been worth while, I'd like to do it again. I've been in a railroad, bank, farm, war, politics, [underlined] love [/underlined] (only once and it still sticks), been busted and still am and yet I have stayed an idealist. I still believe that my sweet heart is the ideal woman and that my daughter is her duplicate. I think that for all the horrors of war it still makes a man if he's one to start with. Politics should make a theif, a roue, and a pessimist of anyone, but I don't believe I'm any of them and if I can get the Kansas City Court House done without scandle no other Judge will have done as much and then maybe I can retire as collector and you and the young lady can take some European and South American tours when they'll do you most good; or maybe go to live in Washington and see all the greats and near greats in action. We'll see. I'm counting the days till I see you.\n\nLots of love to you both, Harry,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"SAINT JOSEPH MO 2 MAY 7 6 PM 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\nHome of KFEQ\n[engraved image, multiple floors, \nbuilding on corner]                                                                                              \nHotel Robidoux   \nSt. Joseph, Mo.

I was supposed to go to Bauxite last night to a boxing match but curtly refused and went to bed at seven thirty. I don't know whether it was the lack of letters or whether I was just feeling mean, anyway I didn't go.\n\n       Yesterday at noon Col. Sullivan, who is the senior regular here and a Lt. Col of Infantry, and I took two of the trainees down to Little Rock to a civic club so they could read a couple of prize essays they had written on Citizenship. The Club gave them medals and they evidently had the event of,their lives. I met an ex governor of Arkansas by the name of Brouf who is a friend of Pendergasts and who was very pleased to see me when he found I knew him.\n\n       There was a swimming meet when we got back to camp and a very good one; although one man was first in every event. The contests were all for second and third places. The boy who won all the firsts is champion 220 yd man for the State so of course the others didn't have much chance. I hope you are all in good health and that you've had as cool weather as we have.

Got your Friday letter this morning and was sure glad to get it. It made the day a lot brighter. I went down home to let your mother read your letter. She almost stands on her head when neither of us get a letter. I also had to get a shirt because I have to stay at the farm again tonight because the paint is still wet on the floor. Mamma says she wishes the paint would stay wet until I have to leave.\n\n             I am planning to take the afternoon train on the Missouri Pacific for St.,Louis on Monday a week from today. I can transact my business in St Louis on Tuesday and then I hope get away from there on Tuesday night. This should put me in Gulfport Thursday night or Friday morning. Will wire you. The reason I was expecting to be until the 20th was because I was expecting to go from St. Louis to Chicago to see about selling notes for the County. If I can sell them at home I won't have to go to Chicago. I'll let you know exactly when to meet me.\n\nKiss my baby and tell her to be a good girl. I am lonesome and homesick to see you both. I hope we never stay apart as long again. But it can't be helped.\n\nLots of love Harry.,[printed]                                                                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"INDEPENDENCE MO MAY 8 530 PM 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n             Office of\n    Jackson County Court\n       Kansas City, Mo.

No one seems to be so very mad at me. They have taken it rather philosophically because they have been looking for it right along.\n\n       Eddie McKim phoned me from Iowa yesterday and asked me to meet him in K.C. for lunch at 1 o'clock; when I met him he was on his way to Jackson, Miss. in a car and wanted me to tell how to get there. He said he would run down to see you if every thing went went in Jackson. So you may have company soon.,Hope you and Natalie had a pleasant day. I haven't seen Nat today so didn't tell him, but I will when I do see him.\n\n      Fred, Frank and George asked me to listen to a discussion of the Mill situation last night and I suggested that they go ahead and get action for their rights which I think they will do. It is the proper thing and since Aunt Maud has already set a precedent by hypothecating her stock for a loan I should think your mother could vote hers. Any way they are going to try it.\n\n      I am hoping to get away by the fifteenth or sixteenth. Should be there by the twentieth or twenty first. I am just counting the days. Don't miss writing to me though for I can hardly wait to see you. Kiss my baby and tell her to be good.   Lovingly  Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"INDEPENDENCE MO.

[/letterhead]   May 9, 1933\nDear Bess:-                                                                                                                                                                       Tuesday\n\n       This is George's birthday and yesterday was mine. I wrote that sentence this morning at 7:30 at seven thirty one the procession started and I have been going ever since. Gates came in at eight and he and Buck and Judge McCardle and I revamped the whole salary list. Alden Millard came in day before yesterday and invited us both (Geo and I) to lunch with him at the President Hotel. We met him and Geo Millard at 12:15 and went to the Meuhlbach and had lunch. I left at one o'clock and went upstairs to a Chamber of Commerce Director's meeting. McElroy was there and you know he nearly always does everything but kiss me when he sees me at a public meeting. He was,up front when I came in and Mr. Mann was talking about the Auditorium. I sat down by Ruby Garrett and let them talk until they got tired. McElroy told them all about the Water Works Bonds and how necessary the Auditorium was and spent nearly a half hour doing it. Well they endorsed his project and then Mr. Mann called on me. I told them about the Court House and they endorsed me and my project unanmously just as they had his. When the show was over he got up and left in a hurry and had never a word to say to me. Rather unusual, but I guess his conscience was hurting him if he has any. After that meeting I went down to the Star and the Post and gave them my speech for tomorrow and then came back to Independence and met a man from Liberty to get him to,help Mize Peters get a job with the State. Boxley invited me to dinner and I went. I am supposed to be at Fairmount now making a speech to Democrats who are holding a social out there. \n\n        But they can go to grass. I got two letters from you this morning and my [underlined] only [/underlined] birthday present this afternoon from my baby. So you see I had to come back to my office and write you both.\n\n        I am about to get everything in shape to leave sooner than I thought. Tomorrow I make my Chamber of Commerce speech about the Court,House, finish with the architects and if I can get Buck and McCardle to do the rest Monday you may get a wire to meet me Saturday the 13th instead of the 20th. How do you like that? I can't stand the strain up here much longer. I had a model of the Court House made at a cost of $300.00 to the County and spent much time and effort getting it ready for my speech tomorrow and the fellow who made it knocked it over and busted it. He's trying by working all night tonight to get it ready anyway but I doubt if he will. The devil has a hand in most things. Be as patient as you can and if I can't leave until the 15th don't be too disappointed for you won't be half as sorrowful as I will.\n\nLove to you both Harry.,[printed]                                                                                         [circular postmark, stamp: \"KANSAS CITY MO MAY 9 1030 PM 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n             Office of\n    Jackson County Court\n       Kansas City, Mo.

There will be two hundred and two less of them than there were on the payroll last year. Thats terrible but it had to be done, and the tax had to be raised besides, but the income with the raise will be less than it was before by some $100,000.00.\n\n       The papers didn't treat me so very badly I guess I'll,[letterhead] Tenth and McGee Streets                                                                            PICKWICK                  Kansas City, Missouri\n                                                                                                                                                              HOTEL  [/letterhead]     \n\nsurvive, -- politically I mean. \n\n            I am hoping the days will fly by now until I can come down. I am going to Topeka tonight to a Legion meeting. I don't think anybody up there can ask me to put him back on Jackson County's payroll. They are expecting Wooding but I doubt if he'll be there.\n\n             The wind has been blowing a gale all day -- blew down two trees in the grove at the farm.

You tell them if they don't I'll take a sharp stick to them when I come down. Be sure and keep on writing for the day is terrible when I don't get a letter.

May 11. 1933_ [/letterhead]\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n        I am in St. Louis this morning. Got here at 7:15 and have just finished breakfast. Will see Judge Charles at noon and Scott Wilson later in the day or tomorrow morning. I should leave here tomorrow night and with luck arrive Saturday evening. I'll wire you when to meet me.\n\n       Yesterday was quite a day. Said my speech to the Chamber of Commerce and by working all night they got the model ready and had it on exhibition. It is a beautiful building and I believe I sold it to them. Even old Battle said I made a good speech, but I,am always rather doubtful of my ability in that line. There was a place card for McElroy at the table but he didn't come. It was the biggest crowd the Chamber had had this year. They asked a lot of questions but they were all apparently friendly. Keene, Wight, Gunn, and Neild were all there and helped me answer the questions. Everyone seemed to go away sold on the idea that the building should be put up. When I get that job done I can probably retire to a quiet job and enjoy life a little bit with my family. Not that I'm not enjoying it now but it is sometimes pretty hard on head and nerves. I can hardly wait to see you both, but it won't be long now, I hope. Be good both of you until I arrive.\n\nLots of love to you both, Harry,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"SAINT LOUIS MO 3 MAY 11 12 -M 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n[colorized image.

It was necessary to make arrangements to discharge some two hundred from the payroll and it was some job. If you don't I had a head ache when it was over you are mistaken. Then I expect to get the panning of my lifetime for not doing more of it.\n\n        I am glad you went to see the destroyer. It was a boat like that I rode on from Duluth to Chicago with the Naval Reserve. They,are not as nice to ride on as the George Washington. It is a wonder Margaret would go where all those big guns are.\n\n        George went to work Monday and seems to like his job fine. He is looking fine. They were up for dinner last night. The old town clock is going full tilt now and keeping proper time.\n\n        I am hoping to get down there sooner than I expected although they have slated me for a talk on radio for May 20th. The weather up here is still cold. I have my overcoat this morning. Tell Margaret I am sending her another funny paper Mr. Cleveland. Fred sent her one Sunday I think.

Everything is set to go at the Chamber of Commerce today and Buck and McCardle have agreed to accept the plans and order the bids advertised for on Monday. It will be better for me to be out of town while the contractors are figuring anyway because they would devil the life out of me. If I'm not here they'll have to figure it on the square and if we get back on the 4th of June that will be too late to do anything.\n\n             You should be glad you are not here; it is as cold as winter today. The fires are going as usual. We have one warm,day and all the rest are cold enough for overcoats.\n\n             The Mill business is going forward. Your mother and Fred are going over to talk to your Auntie Maud and still try for an amicable settlement. I am sure if she were acquainted with the facts she would want to keep the mill running. Those boys are so anxious to get money for that bank that they can't see anything else and I don't blame them for that. But I have urged Frank to take whatever steps are necessary to save the Mill and he's doing it. The meeting is Monday and I know things will be all right. Besides it means a good job for Frank and I believe for George too sometime in the future.\n\nYou may get a wire from me from St. Louis by the time you get this. Kiss my baby. Love to you both \n             \n                                                                                                                  Harry.,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"INDEPENDENCE MO MAY 10 830 AM 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n             Office of\n    Jackson County Court\n       Kansas City, Mo.

[/inserted] It is now 10:25 P.M. and I am at the office in Independence. The town clock is right and you can see it on the white faces same as day time.  The building will be nearly done when you get home. \n\n         I came to work at 7:15 this A.M. to write orders on the discharge of all those employees, went to court and spent hours going over and over the list. Then had a Board meeting this afternoon with the banks. Got nowhere. Their assessment has been balled up by the state board of equilization and by the state tax commission until heads nor tails can be told about it. At five o'clock Buck and I went to Raytown,to a Masonic meeting where Nat Jackson's boy got his 3rd degree and the Grand Master presented him a pin from his mother. Nat wants us to stay in Gulfport until after Natalie's graduation if we can. I told him we would if possible.\n\n         Your mother said only Mrs. King had asked for your address to send Margaret a card. No one has asked me. Please be careful about eating anything that comes in the mail. Someone sent me a cake the other day and I threw it away. With these discharges comming off you cant tell what they'll do. Also [scratched out] watch that water heater in the bathroom. Four people have been asphixiated in the last week with heaters like that. Leave the window open when you use it. Your mother said she wrote you yesterday. She got a letter from Margaret today. Pleased her very much. I am comming down as soon as I can get away and stay as long as we can. Keep on writing. Kiss my baby and tell her she owes me several letters. Lovingly  Harry. [written in page corner] I addressed one of your letters to 219 No Delaware Indp.

Then my responsibility really begins. Last night the[scratched out] officers had a dance at the mess hall, but Col Geyne and I didn't dance. Col Whitten has his wife down here and they took pity on us and took us to the picture show. It was a right good show called from Arizona to Broadway. I have not been without a blanket since arriving, however it gets warm in the day time. They have even furnished my tent with an electric fan. If that isn't a luxurious arrangement for a,soldier. I've never seen one.\n\n      They have a regular Army officer down here by the name of Sullivan who is the Camp Executive. He is a Lt. Col. and a very fine man. He is Military Instructor at Manhattan Kansas State College of Agriculture.\n\n       I have looked in vain for a letter. If I don't get one today you'll get a phone call tonight [underlined] charges reversed. [/underlined]\n\n       Here are some clippings from the Little Rock papers.

Then we called on the State Highway Commission and a number of State Senators and the Chairman of the Highway Commission and Captain Buxton came back to camp with me to dinner.

[/letterhead]  Friday Apr. 28 '33\n\nMy Dear Sweetie:-\n\n       This is letter no. 2 today so you see I am keeping right up with things. I suppose that by the time this reaches you you will have seen all the comments in the Star on County affairs. I have had to go off and hide. I am now on the seventh floor of the Pickwick Hotel. The manager gave me a room without registering so no job holder who wants to stay on can see or phone me. I'll have a Court session tomorrow and then I'm going to Joplin or Columbia or Topeka or St Joe and stay until Monday morning Monday I've got a meeting with the Architects and Wednesday the tenth I've got to make a talk on the Court House to the Chamber,and I hope that after that I can get everything wound up and come to Mississippi about the 18th. That will put me there by the twentieth. That is the best thing in life now that I have to look forward to. I am counting days and hours. I'll write you tomorrow and you'll be one up on me. I've never missed a day writing you but sometimes it would be at 7 A.M. and sometimes at midnight so you might miss getting the letter on time. You count them. I got one this morning and yesterday morning and the day before so I am feeling good. Should get two Monday. What's the matter with my girl? Has she forgotten how to write? Doc Wilson said he'd write her today when I paid his bill. Be sure and kiss my baby. How are your funds?  Lots of love.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Harry,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"KANSAS CITY MO.

It was a red [underlined] letter [/underlined] day. The first time I can remember getting two in one day.\n\n        You've no idea how it feels to sit around all evening, no phone calls, no expectation of seeing Les Bryan or Mrs Bryan or Remick Jones with tales of woe about some thing that can't be remedied. I went to bed at nine o'clock last night and hated to get up this morning.,The Regular Officers were in a terrible stew at breakfast which we just finished over the transfer of Gen. Hagood. They were unable to find out who would succeed him as Corps Area Commander. It finally developed that Gen. McCoy would be the man and everybody was happy.\n\n        The boys go on a practice march today and sleep in pup tents tonight. I hope it doesn't rain. Please keep on writing. The days are a lot brighter when a letter comes. I'm having dinner in town tonight with Eddie McKim.\n\n        I'm still looking for a letter from my daughter.   Lots of love\n                                                                                   Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"2 LITTLE ROCK ARK.

I had written you this morning after about fourteen interruptions. I came to the office at 7:30 and locked my door and some efficient clerk opened it up and I had the time of my life finishing both yours and Margaret's letters.\n\n      It is now about midnight and I don't look for any customers. Have been to Oak Grove to a meeting. There was one at Mt. Washington and one at Grandview. Mary was to make a speech at Oak Grove so I thought I'd better go. I sneaked out after her speech and here I am at,Independence writing to my lady love. I am very glad the brake is behaving itself because I felt uneasy about you driving with it the way it was.\n\n      You'll never know how badly I wanted to stay down there and I'm comming back just as soon as I can. The day has been cold and rainy, the wind in the east all day. The sun has only been out for one day this week. I'm so glad you are having good weather and lots of sun. It is also a satisfaction to learn that you went to church and are going again. A little more church will help the rising the generation and mother has to do it. It's mighty lonesome without you but I can stand it if it makes you both healthier. The vacation will do you as much good as the daughter I know George is doing fine and so are we all. Keep writing.

I have already mailed you one today so this will make up for the one I didn't mail yesterday. I am glad Fred & Christine arrived safely. Hope they had a fine time.\n\n        I do not need any more underwear or white shirts. I wear khaki and olive drab all the time. Even when I go to town which hasn't been but once since I came out. At night we may put on a white shirt with uniform breeches but I don't do it. The boys have to stay in uniform all the time and I make the officers do it too. I have everything running like clock work, even,the constitutional gold bricks are afraid to be seen loafing. The food is good the weather fine and the work interesting. These Arkansas boys are cards, but they are as nice looking and do just about the same amount of devilment as any others. I went to church yesterday morning and sat on the front row. Everyone else had been ordered to go so I had to. The roof didn't fall in and the red haired army chaplain seemed to feel complimented. I'm going to have to pin on a lot of medals [inserted] on other people [/inserted] and make a speech on citizenship besides run the camp but I guess I'll live through it. One of the orders is no cussing. Never saw it in the army.  Tell Margaret to be a good girl. I'm looking for a letter from her.

I am on my way to see Mr. Pendergast and I think Im going to come out all right on the situation.\n\n          There was a family conference last night on the Mill. Uncle Boulwer is bound and determined to sell out and so are the Wells. Frank has been advised that your mother can vote her stock independently and I think that's what they'll do. \n\n           I am so glad the weather has been,agreeable down there. It is still cold enough for a coat here and the wind is in the east this morning. I have been staying in Independence all week but will go to the farm tonight and stay over Sunday. This has been a strenuous week and I'm looking for another one tomorrow, when next week begins. There has never been a time like this. I'll look for a letter today and every day. Tell Margaret I'll write her tomorrow. Hope you've seen Natalie. Tell Miss K. hello and keep writing   lovingly \n                                                                                                                                                                                               Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"INDEPENDENCE MO APR 22 830 AM 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\n\n                                                              Mrs. Harry S.

[/letterhead]  Monday Aug 21, 33\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n      It was certainly a pleasure to have a nice fat letter from you yesterday evening. I was down in the bottom of the dumps because I thought I should have had one on Saturday evidently it takes two days for them to arrive. I'm glad you bought the daughter some shoes she can turn black herself. The clipping and the Examiner were just what I wanted to see. That letter from that old maid stenog was just what you'd expect from a rabid dog. They tried me and convicted the County,Court without a hearing. If I'd opened up on the delegation as I should have they'd have all been in jail for contempt.\n\n      Eddie McKim came to camp yesterday and had dinner with me. He is here to discharge the Arkansas manager of his company. It was almost like seeing one of the family to see him. I hope that Fred and Mrs Fred arrived safely and are as happy as they should be. I'm still a little peeved at him. I'd just made him a present for a job he was supposed to do anyway, just before he left and he should have told me.\n\n      Kiss my daughter and tell her to be a good girl. It is cool enough to sleep under a blanket every night.\n\n                                       Lots of love to you both\n                                                Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"2 LITTLE ROCK ARK.

I was not intending to hard boiled about the letters. I was homesick and woefully disappointed and may [inserted] have been [/inserted] a trifle jealous when two days went by and I go no letter and someone else in the family did.

[/letterhead]    Wednesday 23. 1933\n\nMy Dear Bess:-\n\n          Yesterday was one hell of a day. There were no letters, no papers, nothing from home. I had to, as Camp Commander chase the Y. M. C. A. Secretary off the Post and order him not to come back because the Provost Guard caught him stealing gasoline out of a car with a siphon and a bucket. Two of my young men were caught carrying raincoats out of Camp and not returning with them and to top it all off I ate some hamburger steak night before last for dinner and contracted a first grade stomach ache. You can see that I'm not in a mood to be fooled with this morning.\n\n          However there is a brighter side. I'm looking for two letters today. The outfit,took a six mile practice march yesterday morning made it on schedule and only one man of the three hundred dropped out. I have inaugurated a competitive standing of the Companies and they are at each others throats to win. One got second place yesterday on account of two flies in the dining room. The Company with the best kitchen, cleanest area, neatest tent row and best formation at drill gets mentioned in orders [scratched out] every [/scratched out] that day and a ribbon is pinned on the Company guidon marked \"Best Company\". You'd be surprised how they work for it. It beats balling them out all hollow.\n\n          I hope I get a letter today. Is Margy a good girl?

No letter. I was at the farm yesterday and made up my mind to go and see Neal Williams at Excelsior. He'd gone to Kansas City so I went back and to the Union Station to get a sandwich. I met Doc Johnson and he said that Shannon would be along so I waited and spent a half hour with him talking politics, county, state and national, got home about midnight was in the office at 7:45 this morning and have been going ever since. We've spent the day trying to make a budget. It will require the discharge of some two hundred and two employees,and I suppose I'd as well go to the Gulf and get into [inserted] it [/inserted] when the [underlined] fire [/underlined] works are over.\n\n      I had dinner at Alex Sachs to night and we made speeches at the rose society on the beautification of the County roads.

Hope the show at Gulfport is a success and that you get to see the warship. Tell Margaret not to pull the trigger on any of the big guns or fall overboard. It is now 10:30 and I must go home.

[/letterhead]   Aug 24. 1933\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n       I got two letters yesterday after I'd sent yours. They acted as a cure for all ills. You see the only time I have to write is right after breakfast at around 6:30 A.M. We have breakfast at six. I come over to the office (I have a private one and no one can come in until I tell him to) and write you by that time I hear the adjutant in his office and routine business begins. I head a long complaint yesterday about food in Co. A. Called in the mess officer and listened to him, then the cook in the Company and finally fifteen privates who'd made the kick were heard. I made the cook take them,back to the company and feed them another breakfast. After that I made my usual inspection tour over the camp, complimented some, raise cain with others and by that time it was the hour for the officers meeting. I have one every day at 11:45 and tell them who had the best company that day and why and who had the worst and why also, and then listen to suggestions and sometimes accept them.\n\n       Yesterday afternoon being a holiday we went down to Bauxite about twenty five miles to Andy Mellon's aluminum mine, the largest of its kind in U.S. It was very interesting. Talcum powder and emery wheels are a by produce. Emery dust and talcum powder come from the same kind of rock that,[letterhead]                                                                                                            Harry S.

[/letterhead]\n\nthe aluminum dust comes from. It was a very interesting trip. About ten of the officers went down. The Supt of the is a Reserve officer so we were treated royally.\n\n        Today at 10:30 I have to make a speech on Citizenship and [inserted] at 4:30 P.M. [/inserted] pin a decoration on a doctor from Little Rock in the name of the President.\n\n        Eddie McKim was out to see me last night after I'd gone to bed. I went bet 8:30 so he wasn't to blame for that. He left about 10:30 and is going home today. I hope my daughter is a good girl as she should be. She hasn't written her dad yet. Maybe she's too busy practicing. I'm glad she's starting again because I,do want her to be a pianist.\n\n       I wish you were both here. It has been lovely so far as weather is concerned and I'm sure you'd have had a good time. I hope your mother's foot is all right. There are a lot of men in that profession. I'm glad you got a good one. Well here comings the morning woe so I'll have to postpone until tomorrow.

We could build a fine one if we had the funds. I sincerely hope we can find them. From a financial viewpoint things are getting no better. But I doubt if they can get worse. \n\n       The Board of Appeals on real estate starts tomorrow and I certainly dread it but it has to be done.,That is what I came home for\n\n       The Star seems to be softening up somewhat but they have planted a lot of poison.\n\n       How is my baby? I want to see both of you so badly. I believe I'm actually homesick, but don't you pay any attention to that. You do your job and I'll do mine and we'll both be all right. I'm hoping for a happy summer when you come home and I'm hoping we'll never be separated again. Remember to Miss Kinaman and kiss my good girl for me. Tell I'm still looking for her letter. I am well and feeling fine, physically. George is much better to day. He was asleep when I went to see him. Write often.

[/letterhead] Monday 28 Aug 33\n\nDear Bess:-\n \n         Well the camp is drawing rapidly to a close. I'll probably be starting for home when you get this. I want to be there Wednesday evening if I possibly can. Gov. M. Nutt of Indiana is comming on Thursday morning and I'm responsible for him, so I'll have to meet him.\n\n         Fred Canfil came in to see me yesterday morning and stayed about an hour and then went back. He made the drive just for that. General Hagood made an official call yesterday and went over the camp. His principle reason for comming down here was to pay a visit to the conservation camps. There,are a dozen or so in Arkansas.\n\n         We got no mail yesterday so of course there was no letter. This will in all probability be your last one. I suppose Margaret has forgotten entirely how to write. That's too bad because  I expected to make a special trip to Little Rock and now I won't have to.\n\n         I hope you are all well and that the weather is fine. It has been hot for the last two days but not seriously that way. Been trying to rain and hasn't succeeded.\n\n         Kiss my baby even if she doesn't think of her dad any more.\n\n                       Lots of love\n                                           Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"2 LITTLE ROCK ARK.

Got a letter from you and Margaret and you've no idea what a difference that makes. It must have been some rain. I wish that I'd been there to see it. Stayed at Independence last night and the night before. Fred wanted to go out and I stayed with your mother.\n\n        George came home last night and he looked fine. I was down there and stayed an hour. He is going to stay in until Monday and then go back to work.\n\n        Nat Jackson was in to see me and said that Natalie was just standing on her head to see you or hear from you. He,said that the President of the School had made arrangements for me to have dinner or something while I was down there and he seemed very much disappointed that I hadn't seen his daughter. Please get in touch with h er and write me about it.\n\n        This has been a dizzy week, every day I've been listening to the woes of the taxpayers and getting no where. I am going to straighten things out before another week. It is raining here now and I am hoping it isn't down there.

[/letterhead] Sunday 27 Aug. 33\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n      I finally got one letter yesterday afternoon. It helped the day wonderfully. You've no idea how terribly lonesome it is in a camp on a half holiday. All I could do was to watch a bridge game, be bored by border service stories or listen to Col Sullivan tell about Kansas St Agricultural College R.O.T.C.  Being not vitally interested in any of them, all I could do was get out my high brow detective literature and entertain myself. I read you letter about six times and then went back and read all I had recieved. I could have gotten in the car and gone to Little Rock,to a show but that would have been no fun. All these officers are strangers to me and none of them want to go anywhere with the Camp Commander anyway.\n\n     While it looks good from the side lines to have control and get your name in both papers every day and pictures every other day it's not a pleasant position. However it's good experience.\n\n      I had a pest of mosquitoes last night for the first time too. They must have read your letter. Don't bother about the Fraher woman. Someday maybe I can afford a man secretary who'll stay on the job. Please don't miss any more days writing. I guess Margaret's forgotten how.

[/letterhead]  May 6 1933      \n\nDear Bess:-\n\n         This day was much better. There were two letters from you and one from my baby and the folks at home got one. We were certainly glad to hear from you. I get so uneasy when I don't hear I can hardly keep from wiring. I am glad you are happier without the nurse. I never did think she would be a success but I know I'd never get you there if we didn't take her, so she served her purpose. It would not have been possible for me to stay away as long as was necessary to accomplish the result we want. If the,young lady comes home sound and well I guess we can stand it, although I've never been so lonesome since I was a little boy. Natalie almost came down but told me just now that Frank should not be left at home because he wouldn't eat what he ought. He wanted her to go but she said she'd worry about him all the time and it would be no pleasure. I thought once I had her on the way. Today is the first sunny day this week and also the first one warm enough to be without an overcoat. Neild didn't bring his coat from Shreveport and he nearly froze. I am hoping to leave not later than the fifteenth so be as patient as you can. I am glad your weather is getting better. Don't fail to write every day.\n\nLovingly, Harry.,[printed]                                        [circular postmark, stamp: \"INDEPENDENCE MO MAY 6 430 PM 1933\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n             Office of\n    Jackson County Court\n       Kansas City, Mo.

[/letterhead]\tApril 28, 33.\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n       Well I did it and the Post treated me fine - the Star gave a me kick. I had been to see each of them and expected the same treatment from each. The Star is off me anyway. I think our friend at the City Hall has been \"helping me out\" down there. I'll sure be glad when this job is finished. The Court has been working all day every day and I've been going half the night. I'm going to the farm tonight and stay over Sunday and may be it will calm down. \n\n        We are discharging some 200 people and everyone of them and all his friends will try to see me. I was sick last night after the session and lost my supper but I'm,going strong again this morning. Gates and Oscar were over last night and I had to run off to bed without saying much to them. Gates was down at Frank's but I don't think either of them changed his position. \n\n        Every time I get a letter I wish I was down there. This has been a good week. I've had a letter every day but one.\n\n        I wonder if my little girl has been to busy to write her Dad? You must have had a great time going crabbing. I hope you caught some fish. Can't you make reservations for next fall and stay down there all winter? I am of the opinion that our baby would be entirely cured by that. Maybe I could get a job down there. We'll have to talk about the Washington job. There are several angles to it that have to be studied.

I guess we'll have to tie a pink ribard around Margaret arm and then we can tell. I hope she stands still long enough to gain ten pounds. Please don't get too homesick, I am counting on staying with you down there at least ten days. I've had my radio speech set up to 9 P.M. central standard time May 6. The equilization board finished this afternoon and it was a [underlined] finish [/underlined]. The banks were in there for four solid hours figuring us out and in and then out again. I finally got a settlement which I [inserted] am [/inserted] doubtful of but which,is the best we can do. Spent the whole morning getting payrolls and salary cuts made and expect to do the same thing tomorrow morning. Tomorrow afternoon have to make a budge for the engineer and the next day have to pass finally on the Court House, make a radio speech on it May 6 and Chamber of Commerce one on May 10. Advertise for both on it and try to sell 200000 of bonds. I am hoping to get all that wound up by May 15 and then get to St Louis and see Judge Charles and come to Mississippi. We'll go see Hanger Chew in Burninham and the new Court House there, then to Montgomery, Nashville, Louisville and home about June fourth or fifth. The Lt. in Little Rock wrote me that I may not get to camp so I'll make this my vacation. How are your funds?

Even the mail orderly had found out how to approach me with a request. He'll make it when he's handing me your letter.\n\n       I pinned some medals on the old doctor from Little Rock yesterday and got my picture in the Gazette again. That's the third time. I haven't seen a Star for so long I've forgotten what it looks like. I hope the County is running as it should. I've not worried a great deal. There was only one mistake made,on this trip and that was when you and Margy didn't come down with me. I get awful lonesome in the evening. Even tried to play contract bridge last night and set my partner at stated intervals. Being a major however he was very polite about it and didn't tell me straight out that I knew nothing about it.\n\n       I hope I get a letter today. Glad you called mamma. I guess I'll write her today for the first time since I arrived. Hope my daughter hasn't forgotten how to write. We may have to put her back  in the first grade this fall.\n\n                                                                        Love to you both\nThanks for the                                                                    Harry.\nbuttons I'll need\nthem tomorrow.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"2 LITTLE ROCK ARK.

After mailing your letter this morning I walked from the Governor Clinton Hotel at Thirty-First and Seventh Avenue to 4 West Tenth Street, where Mr. Keck has his studio and also where he lives. It was a long walk but interesting even if it was cold as it could be, almost. I went over to Broadway and walked down Broadway to Twenty-Third, where the Flatiron Building is and then walked down Fifth Avenue to Tenth. People were rushing this way and that and jaywalking against lights and everything else so that the worst hick town can have nothing on,<letterhead>                                                      The Willard Hotel \n                                                                          Washington, D.C. </letterhead>  \n\nNew York-at least not this morning from eight-fifty until nine-forty on two of their busiest streets.\n\nMr. Keck had four Andrew Jacksons and the castings of the friezes of Law and Justice. We are going to be proud of them I tell you. He says that the Law, which is Moses, will be better than Mohamet and I believe him. We took Andy all apart and put one man on one horse and then tried him on another until there was a combination that will be unbeatable. Mr. Keene and Mr. Wight were both there and we spent a most en,<letterhead>                                                      The Willard Hotel \n                                                                          Washington, D.C. </letterhead>  \n\njoyable morning after which Mr. Keck took us around on Sixth Avenue to a fine eating place, gave us a real martini, oysters, roast beef and everything. Then I caught a taxi and my train and here I am back in politics. From the height of the esthetic to the basement of the practical, and I confess I like them both.\n\nTomorrow I'm to see Senator Clark and Mr. Burr and the rest and really make up my,<letterhead>                                                      The Willard Hotel \n                                                                          Washington, D.C. </letterhead>  \n\nmind on what I'm to do.\n\nI wish you and Margy were here to share this immense room. They are treating me as if they thought I amounted to something at the hotel anyway, even if they will skin me to death on the cost, it makes a difference. When Neal and Lewis come I'll make them take over a share of it anyway. When I get things as I want them you'll always be with me.

Mr. and Mrs. Howell are going to California and they are going to pack up their silver and linen and store it. She first said she'd leave her deposit up on the gas and electric bill, but now she wants to take them down so I guess it'll be better that way.\n\nI took one of the boys to dinner last night Bryan Lomax a St. Louis boy who lives with John and Harry. He took me to the Metropolitan to see,Crime and Punishment a very good show. Harry and John are going to dinner with me tonight, and tomorrow I'll go out to Oscar's house for dinner. John Thompson is going to lunch with me today. The President will be back in town tomorrow and I suppose things will liven up.\n\nYou've no idea how tired I was and I guess the let down was for a two year period. I'm not starting home until Dec 21st if that suits you. It'll take me until then to rest up. I didn't go to Kentucky, still too tired. I hope to get letters regularly now and you'd as well send them as usual and save 3 cents.

You've no idea how very pleasant that is. If you and Margey had just come on with me everything would be perfect.

I keep wanting to do something - there's a driving force inside me that makes me get into things. I can't sit still and do nothing. I've,read the interstate commerce law in the last two days and will start on the court decisions unless something interferes. I'm going to be better informed on the transportation problem than anyone here, including Eastman, if I can manage it.

There are half a dozen books I'd like to have but I can't think of them now you ask me. Mamma will appreciate any book you pick out. Mrs. Shields asked me to dinner last Friday but I didn't go.

I expect we'd better bring some though for safety.\n\nGo on and charge your clothes. We'll get it done. Certainly we ought to come out even on the rent here this time. I'm sure we can.\n\nThere were four telegrams waiting for me this morning when I came in and I can't help any of them. One from T.J. recommending a good for nothing bird for a job and I won't recommend him. One about a bank in Salisbury Mo which wants to open and can't.

I guess they think I wouldn't have any influence with the Republican committee anyway and I guess I wouldn't. Roy Roberts has been here for three or four days and I haven't seen him.

The Insurance commissioners are having a meeting in New York and have asked me to come up there. I may go and not go to the meeting.,Went out to see Tuck Milligan this morning at the hospital. He's a very sick man. Has lost a lot of blood as the result of an abscess on the bladder. He said he was getting along fine and was as pleased as he could be to see me. Mrs. Milligan told me though that the doctor and nurse thought his chance of recovery is very slim. He's been too weak to operate and the place can't be properly drained. It seems that a senatorial campaign was too much for him and Cochran, too. I think I ought to be nice to them both though.\n\nThe president's asst. sec. called me and wants me to endorse Chas. M.

The Appropriations Committee just had a real meeting. They argued and argued over Indians and milk investigations and all sorts of useless things and it was 4:30 when I got back to the Senate. They were still arguing on the same amendment to the A.A.A. so I hadn't missed anything.\n\nJudge Kimbrough Stone was waiting to see me and asked me to come over to his Delaware Beach place and spend a weekend. I don't think I'll go but it was nice of him to ask me. Keene and his,new wife came to the hotel and took me to dinner. She knows you but I couldn't figure out who she was. She seemed to know everybody in Independence.\n\n            Louis McGee and Jerry Walsh wanted me to go to dinner with them too but I didn't. Couldn't eat two. They were pie eyed anyway and wanted me to go to the Shoreham.

Nobody missed me either I don't think. It was held out an outdoor eating place a short distance east of the Chevy Chase Club. It was a fine place.\n\nA Maine Congressman had been made an Admiral in the Nebraska Navy at the suggestion of Burke and Eddie McKim's friend, the Congressman from Omaha, McLaughlin by name. The gentleman from Maine furnished a barrel of lobsters and Burke gave the party. It was a nice party. The President's Sec.,Mr. McIntyre was there, Mr. West who has had his name in the papers recently, the one Senator from Ohio [Bulkley], the two from Missouri and two from Indiana and several more besides a half dozen Congressmen from Nebraska and Maine. There was a square table out on the lawn about a hundred feet around and hollow in the center. There was beer etc, etc and when the singing began I left. Minton, Clark, McIntyre and Tumulty, Wilson's Secretary were the quartette.\n\n           I am going to see Margaret's dentist this morning to get a front tooth fixed.

That dark one and the one I broke at home. The gold had become loose in the dark one and that's what made it dark. Dr. Marshall took out the gold, ground out the black, and put in a white filling and that tooth is as white as any I have now. It had begun to hurt a little, hence the fixing.\n\nThere was no letter when I got back and I had to go to the Appropriations Committee to argue a $240 million deficiency bill. It,was noon when I got back to the office. Bell had to come over and see me. He'd been to N.Y. to see T.J. He wanted me to know that T.J. thought I was all right. Of course that wasn't any news to me. I had to see Duncan and Wood about Murray matters. I'd promised the boys out at Camp Mead I'd take them through the Naval Academy so I had to leave without a letter.\n\n               I took a Baltimore bath and came to the office this A.M. at eight-thirty and there was yesterday's letter. I was sure glad to get it. I sent you some stationery yesterday although the slightly yellow brand you are using is all right.,[letterhead]                                                                       Harry S.

[/letterhead]\n\nI don't care what stationery you use as long as I get the letter.\n\n          Yes Mrs. Griggs is deviling me for a job. I can't get her one because she can't do anything but cook and that's not the sort of job she wants. She'd like one, so John says, where she could draw her pay and not do much work. People are never grateful or satisfied and since I don't expect them to be either I'm never disappointed.\n\n         How did the kids' party and show come out? I saw it rated mention in the hometown paper of Thursday. The Star had quit coming and I'm not going to send them $7.50 for an-,other six months. The Post comes for nothing.\n\n           Doc Copeland sent me his book called the Dr. Copeland's Home Medical Book, by Royal S. Copeland M.D., a Physician of National Reputation, with the Doc's picture on the cover. There are 582 pages and I'm wondering if he'll bill me for it, remembering of course the experience of the beauty parlor operator at the Shoreham.\n\n          I'm going to mail this letter in the post office so you ought to get it on time. Rust is comming to see me about the 1424 16th Street apartment tomorrow. I'll tell you what he says then. Kiss my baby. Loads of love & keep writing.      Harry\n\nGlad you're homesick.

I wanted to see you and Margey so badly after I'd talked to you that I almost played baby. It was a fine thing to listen to you anyway. We'll never do this again. We've got to work out some way to make ends meet and have a place to live in Washington. I'm thinking about moving August 1 because I'm paying twice too much rent. I see places advertised every day from $40.00 to $55.00 that would be just as nice as where I pay that much every two weeks.,You need not send the book Nellie brought over. I'm hoping to read it if I ever get a chance. Yes I was at Strickler's house for dinner. Keene's stayed at the LaFayette. I only saw them the one time.\n\n                 About that 1424 apartment. I don't think they'd split it but the one way. Dan Nee, of course, would like to be governor but I am doubtful of his making the race. While Pendergast and Clark are friendly now, I'm of the opinion that they won't stay that way if Clark gets a notion he's strong enough to overturn the machine. If he had the governor, he could do it. Pendergast isn't so dumb, but while he has the whole show now he knows he can't,[letterhead]                                                                                     Harry S. Truman\n                                                                                                           Independence, Mo. [/letterhead] \n\nkeep it forever. Clark, as you know, is a potential candidate for the White House in 1940. He's been trying to be a radical conservative. That, you know, is some job. Pendergast hasn't made up his mind yet who will be governor. He'll announce it sometime soon. If the man is smart and politically minded he can say who Clark's successor will be and can deliver the 1940 delegation at the national convention. Clark is in St. Louis now opening a law office. You know he's just as hard up as we are but his wife doesn't know it. He played utility stocks in,Insull's heyday and lost. He told me he had to borrow all he could get to keep out of the courts and that he was still doing it. So he's opening this law office to try and make some money honestly. I think Clark's ethics are of the highest order and I'm sure that's one reason he's busted.\n\n               Well you'd better put this in a safe place because it may not work out that way. Don't let any of our job holders work you into any political hole. I know you're too smart to let 'em do it. Your White House press interview showed you're a genius. Just keep it up.

I'm afraid he's going to be a nuisance.\n\n                        Went down to see General Craig this morning and had a most pleasant visit with him.

I over slept thirty minutes, but had read over the mail that came Saturday and Sunday so that made no particular difference. I waited for the first mail to come in and there was no letter from you. I'd started to write you and Jane came in to take the letters so I thought I'd get through,with her and then write. Paul Dillon from St. Louis came in. I had to listen to him. The Old Man Downey from St. Joseph, Forest Smith and his wife, a woman Postmaster from Monroe City one right after the other and it was noon. Jane still has some dictation coming. You asked me about John's new girl - well her name is Phyllis something or other Hanlon I believe. She came here to see Mrs. Faris and landed a stenogs job in one of the emergency agencies.\n\n                 I am doubly happy today. I got another letter just as I started for the Senate. I'm glad the party and show the kids gave was a success. Send me the write up in the Times. I don't get it any more.\n\n                I slept all yesterday afternoon and then walked down in town for lunch and went to see Grace,Moore in her latest picture. It is a dandy. She sings part of three or four operas. It's the best show I've seen this year. It's the first one I've been to since you left.\n\n                 The apartment man came in to see me and offered to rent one of those like the Smiths in the same building on third floor unfurnished for $150.00 per mo. He said they probably would cut it up and rent the pieces for 90.00 to 110.00. I still have two,more to look at. One at 19th and S right across from the school and one at 1921 Kalorama Road. The Highlands have one to rent too. I think I ought to get what we want from $7500 to $9000 and even if we have to take a whole years lease we won't be out as much as we were this year.\n\n                  That apartment where the Smiths are is a beauty, but,there are four bedrooms and three baths. Which is a lot of room and would mean a lot of furniture.\n\n        I am due at an appropriations committee meeting at 2:00 and it is 1:45 now.\n\n         Hope I get two letters every day.

So I guess I'll have to phone collect to see if you are all up and around. You don't know how badly I feel when I don't get a letter. I had a terrific headache yesterday. Went to Baltimore last night and got one excellent boiling out - feel fine this morning. In fact I'd be in excellent spirits if that letter had been here when I came in - nothing but squawks from job hunters in the bundle.,I am going to dinner with Bud today, with Johnnie and Harry Tuesday, and with Oscar Wednesday. Oscar came in to see me yesterday afternoon and I judge he is doing well with his job. He looks fine and seems to be as happy as can be. Ask Margaret how many weeks allowance are coming to her and if she has been a good girl. I'm glad to hear of that good report card. It sure will be a wonderful improvement when you all get here.

I took the one home yesterday at three o'clock and read it four or five times. I am sorry I made the telegram so formal but I was trying to make Uncle Sam pay for it. Had a letter from Murray this morning--it was a night telegram in which he said he'd appointed a fellow from Joplin to the job. It was old Amos Hatton's son-in-law and I'd told him to take care of him. I wrote him a letter today and told him to be,sure and take care of Coen. He'll do it too I'm sure. I hope Margie's show was a grand success. I know very well what you were thinking of on the picnic. I thought of it too but didn't see how I could get out of going without hurting somebody's feelings and since no harm was done no one can say anything.\n\n                  I'd like very much to build the house and we'll look it over when I get home. But you know a house said to cost $8,500 will cost $10,500 and it is necessary to have a lot clear - and one where we'd want to be will cost $2,500 anyway. So you can see how it piles up. There would be at least $2,000 or $2,500 in furniture too. Maybe I can make,[letterhead]                                                                             Harry S.

If I'd played my hunch last fall we'd have had enough to build two houses. My 1920 experience buying a house almost made a coward out of me.\n\n                  Mrs. Hugh Smith called and said there were two vacancies now at their place and I am going to talk to the agent tomorrow. We'll consider the building however.\n\n                   It is said we'll be done on Aug. 15th. I hope so. I am awful tired and awful lonesome. I went to the hotel at 3 P.M. yesterday and slept until 6:30 and then went to dinner with Ruby Garret and some 42nd Division men at the,Occidental. They paid for the dinner. There were no drinks and I got to bed at 9:30. Senator Burke is having a stag party tonight. I hope this will be the last one.\n\n               Be sure and keep writing. If you feel like giving me hell do it. I probably need it a lot of times when I don't get it.\n\n                Kiss Margaret for me and keep on writing - lots of love.\n\n                                                                                            Harry,[handwritten; underlined] Special Delivery  [/handwritten; underlined]\n                                                            [circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C.

She thought there would be bed linen enough; she'd come downtown to buy some pillowcases. She thought perhaps you'd better bring some tablecloths, said there'd be doilies [inserted] napkins [/inserted] and things like that for breakfast but she wanted to take her tablecloths with her. There is a garage in the basement at $$5.00 per month and thirty five,cars occupy the space of twenty, so I'd imagine it's about like the one last year. He said the street is packed most of the time. She wanted to leave her silver but when I told her we had ours she said she would store hers. They are moving out December 23 after having all rugs and curtains cleaned. The apartment manager is supposed to clean floors and walls and said she'd do it. I don't know just when I'll leave for home. There are a hundred things to be attended to here and the sob boys find it a little more difficult to reach me here.

I was most sorry to hear of Heinzelman's death. He was a real man. He came of a line of them.\n\nWe had quite a session yesterday. Wheeler and the Senator from Ill. Mr. Deitrich [sic] almost came to blows. The young upstart from West Va. had to make a speech too. I'm afraid he has ambitions to be a second Huey. I don't know what we'll do with two of them. He had,a very good audience however, and I'll have to admit made a good speech.\n\n               I went out to Bud's to dinner last night. Johnnie and his girl were there and the five of us played a card game called \"dynamite.\" I got home about eleven o'clock. I am going to dinner with the new Senators tonight at the expense of the Junior Senator from Calif. Mr. Wm. Gibbs McAdoo. There are to be no ladies, for which I'm right thankful. You don't know how I look for the letters and how I wish I were home. Please send at least one every day. Lots of love and remember me to all the family. Kiss Margey.

It will take all day and I think most of tomorrow to get done. The appropriations committee had its last meeting this morning on the [underlined] 3rd [/underlined] deficiency bill. I guess if we'd stay another month we'd have another one. I'm glad it's cool out there. It is very pleasant here,today. The wind is in the north and I have on a blue suit and it is comfortable.\n\n                  Duke Shoop was talking to me and he thought Colorado would be a good place so he just sent us out there. We can consider it anyway. It won't take us long to start and we'll arrive somewhere. It looks like I won't get away until Monday. Pendergast wants to see me and Clark and I'm of the opinion that everything will be settled when we see him. Wouldn't the papers give something to know that? We'll leave here tomorrow for N.Y. and get back Sunday afternoon. If I catch an early train will probably start from here Sunday afternoon for home. Should get there Tuesday sometime and then we'll leave,for somewhere - Colorado if you want it or any other direction except St. Louis.\n\n                    I have been exceedingly tired the last few days trying to listen to and read everything. I bet I can sleep a week when I get away. Hope everybody is well. Kiss Margey.

There were only five new Senators there. Burke, Schwellenbach, Murray, Bilbo, and the junior senator from Missouri. Hatch, Clark, Bachman, Van Nuys, Russell of Georgia, Dietrich, Lonergan, Bob Reynolds, Neely, Bulow, and someone else who is a two-year-old was there. Sixteen sat down and it was a fine dinner served upstairs in a grand suite. Everybody got to air his grievance against the administration and everybody had one. Bilbo and I kept still but it was a very interesting side,light on how the political affairs of the nation are handled by the brain-trusters. Old man Lonergan said he was against everything they are doing but he'd keep on being a Democrat and voting, he supposed, for what he didn't believe. Neely was the bitterest of all and I think probably he had a right to be. His worst enemies were given the best jobs. McAdoo let Clark preside and after about five had talked I slipped around to the host and left, it was then eleven-thirty and I suppose there were at least five more speeches. I am at the office though at 7:00 A.M. as usual.,[letterhead]                                                                                    Harry S.

It came on time yesterday afternoon. Carl Gray is a son of the president of the Union Pacific. He was once president of the Missouri Reserve Association and the national one too. I think he is now vice-president of the Great Northern or one of those railroads up there. He was a great friend of Colonel Elliott and claimed to be one of mine. I don't know whether to send him anything or not. I wouldn't send Roper anything.\n\n          I have been watching the papers on apartments but have had no chance to look yet. Your suggestion about Margey's bed is O.K. I thought,I'd call Mr. Leonard before I leave for home and ask him if he'd rent that fourth-floor two-bedroom apartment in 3011 at a reasonable rate by the year. There have been some nice six-room houses advertised for lease too. But heat and upkeep are terrible and I haven't looked at any of them yet.\n\n          I'm sorry to hear of Judge Beeman. He was a good-natured fat man and never was the same after he went broke. It takes a tough citizen to climb down the ladder after being at the top and he couldn't stand it. I'm looking for a letter today. Kiss Margey - she sent me a grand letter.

We went through the calendar in short order yesterday and it looks as if we'd wind up a lot of controversial legislation Monday and Tuesday and probably begin adjournment on Wednesday. I ought to be starting home Sunday of next week. I forgot to put a special on yesterday's letter. My mind doesn't work anymore I guess. I have been worried for fear I'd never find out what it's,all about. I sat on a committee to hear all about why the airlines should be put under the Interstate Commerce Committee. I reported the bill and got it on the calendar for Sen. McCarran and then forgot what it was all about. Had to read the proceedings from start to finish. That ought not to happen and wouldn't have ten years ago. Maybe I need a holiday. I wrote your daughter a letter after reading about the other baby's shoes in your letter yesterday. It was great to watch her grow up, and I hope it will be as happy from now on.\n\nHope to see you soon.

Just now discovered it.\n\n                I went to dinner with Col Stevenson and an Ohio judge last night at the Army and Navy Club. It was a nice dinner and I could find no ulterior motive for it. Got back to the Lafayette at 8 o'clock and sat out in front and talked to Ford, the manager and Stonebreaker. He's the fellow who was,at the Hamilton. He went swimming last Sunday and got so badly sun burned that he has been in bed ever since.\n\n              We spent all yesterday afternoon on Wheeler's water transportation bill. I presided most of the time. Doc Copeland is against it because he has a ship subsidy bill he wants to pass. Today we take up the Wheeler-Rayburn Utility Bill again. There'll be plenty of scrambling on that. Associated Press man told me T.J. landed in N.Y. yesterday morning. I wonder what brought him back so soon.

I am so lonesome for you and Miss Margey I don't know what to do. I guess I shouldn't have said that after Johnie's remark but it's true.\n\n             I am having dinner with Bud tonight. He just came in and asked me. My eating expense will be well within,bounds this week if it keeps up. So far I've only had to buy two meals a day since Saturday.

Had intended to go to New York last night but didn't because I had a headache and went to bed at seven o'clock. Got up at six this morning and feel fine. I think I've found out what is making me so tired. Those new spectacles don't work. I just wasted about forty dollars on them. I'm going to have my old ones put back in the good frames and let it go at that.\n\nYou don't know how I wish you were here. Dreamed about you last night. Thought we were going through,a flood together. We got through without disaster. The weather has been fine - sunshine every day. I have been taking a walk every morning and I think soon as I get my glasses fixed I won't have any more tired spells. Send me some of your cards. The Brazilian Embassy is having a reception and I'll send them out. It is next Friday and Saturday. How many are you supposed to leave?

I got to the office at 6:30, read all the mail, straightened up my desk. Went to breakfast at 8:30, finished dictating to Jane at 9:45, and went out on Sixteenth Street to see three places advertised in the Post this morning. Went,to 1925 Sixteenth first - it is a block from the Roosevelt, south, in the middle of the block between T and U. The apartment was on the fourth floor. It had a nice living room, small dining room and kitchen, two bedrooms, and two full baths. It was a very nice apartment and they wanted $87.50 for it. It was on the Sixteenth Street side. Then I went out to 2400 Sixteenth Street. They showed me the nicest apartment I've seen. It was on the west side with windows on three sides. A fine large living room, large dining room. Two nice bedrooms and two baths. It was a beauty, No. 312, a lucky number, but they wanted $150.00 per month without maid service and no furniture. They'll furnish it for $225.00, so I went away with my head down. Then I went to the Presidential at 1016 Sixteenth Street. It faces east,on Sixteenth between K and L. They had a nice apartment with a living room, dining room, kitchen, two bedrooms, and one bath. Plan, about the same as 1925 Sixteenth. They wanted $110.00. There was another on the seventh floor, the first one was on the fifth, with two bedrooms, living room, and kitchen, no dining room. Bedrooms were very small. Wanted $75.00 for that and that's all I saw. Will look further tomorrow.

[/letterhead] \nWashington D.C.\n Dec 4 1935\n\nDear Bess:-\n\n             I overslept again this morning. It seems that for some reason I'm way behind on sleep. It was 10:00 A.M. before I got started on an apartment hunt again and I found one for $130 per month all furnished and everything. Bud and I went looking again this morning and stopped again at the Sedgwick to see how the unfurnished apartment would look. Vic and I stopped there yesterday and were told we could see it by appointment. We made the appointment for eleven o'clock, in the meantime looking for anything we could see. We looked at one on,Biltmore just east of the new bridge on Calvert Street. It had squeaky floors and worn-out rugs, but a Weber grand piano, one old-fashioned bathroom but the rent was $125. We marked it off the list and went on up to the Sedgwick. When we got there the apartment was occupied by H. Comer Howell, son of the famous Clark Howell, editor and owner of the Atlanta Constitution. Evidently a remittance man of a great family. He had a fat wife who evidently ran things. The apartment was ideal. Two bedrooms, two baths, nice large living room, small dining room, fine kitchen, and all kinds of light and air. Rental $130 month. They were pleased to death for me to have it and I could have kissed them for letting me have it. I'll bet,[letterhead]                                                                \nHarry S. Truman                         \nIndependence, Mo. [/letterhead]\n\nthat there isn't another one available like it in the town at twice the price. I sent them a check for $130 as soon as I got back to the office and she called up to know if we wanted her silver too. Scared me to death, I thought she wanted to cancel out on me. They will move out on Christmas Day and we can come in any time after that. If I hadn't come on, we'd never have gotten it. It sure is a load off my mind.\n\n               I am now going to go somewhere and really rest for a couple of days. Guffey wants me to go to Kentucky next Tuesday to the inauguration of the new Governor to succeed Laffoon. If I feel as happy as I do now I may go. Saw Guffey, Wagner,O'Mahoney and Black today. They all seemed very much pleased to see me. I am going to attend hearings on appropriations, over at the House tomorrow. Kiss my baby and it looks like we're all fixed for this season. I'm hoping for a letter tomorrow.\nLots of love to you both,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 13 DEC 4 8-PM 1935\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

C.    [/letterhead] June 27, 1935\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nI went to Duke Shoup's last night for a chicken dinner. Ted Alford was there, Congressman Hennings and Ed Villmore. Mrs. Alford you know has gone to the coast over in Delaware somewhere. We had a fine time discussing all the political happenings of the last few days. I got home at eleven-thirty was up at,six and had breakfast at six thirty signed all my mail read the papers and got all my dictation over early and then went out to look for a room. I waited and waited for a letter but it didn't come.\n\n                         The Dodge wanted from $18.00 to 30.00 a week for a room. The $24.00 one was the only one I could use. The other had windows on one side and very small closets. The $18.00 one was a shower bath only. The Continental showed me a nice room for $17.50. I went up to see Stonebreaker at the Hamilton and he had a nice room for $75.00 per month but they let him go effective July 1st so I refused to take the room. He and I went over to the Lafayette to see his friend in charge there. He showed me a beautiful room, better than any I'd,seen for which he indicated he'd make the price right somewhere between sixty and seventy five a month. I've an idea I'll end up by going to the Continental. The Army and Navy Club was not satisfactory. The wanted $2.25 a day for room with [scratched out] private [/scratched out] connecting bath for two rooms $2.00 for no bath and $2.50 for private bath. The rooms weren't very nice. I sure hope I'll find a letter when I go back to the office.\n\nKiss the baby and loads of love Harry.,[letterhead]                                                                                               United States Senate\n                                                                                                                         Washington, D. C.    [/letterhead]\n\nWell the letter came on the one o'clock mail and Bud brought it over to me. You tell Margaret she is not doing as I told her and for every day she doesn't practice one hour you are to take something off her allowance. If she does the whole hour,nothing is to come off. If she does only a half hour five cent fine, three quarters of an hour a three cent fine no practice at all a ten cent fine and that goes from now on. I hate to have to make a potentially great pianist work by fining her.\n\n                       I am sorry to admit that I haven't written Miller but I will when I get back to the office. I don't know why Mrs. Clark didn't have her party before you left. I guess if she'd been a real diplomat she'd not have asked me because I'd never have known about it. It is as,hot as Hades today and I have on my light brown suit instead of a white one. When I get moved I can run over and change when it gets hot. It looked like rain when I left home. Please keep on writing.

We finished up at 12:15 A.M. yesterday and didn't do as much business as we did in four hours the day before. Old Hiram Johnson is talking on neutrality this morning. He's already spoiled an hour and there's no telling how,much longer he'll talk. Everybody is very anxious to quit, so he's not getting much house.            \n\n                      That was a nice letter from the woman who found the ten. I can't even remember what I was doing with money in a shirt pocket. I'm glad you gave her half of it.\n\n                       I'm also pleased that Margaret's arm is all right. She evidently isn't able to write yet, because I have no letter from her.\n\n                       There is only one thing in the way of adjournment in a hurry. The cotton Senators are threatening a filibuster against the deficiency appropriation unless the A.A.A. withdraws its order to lend only nine cents a pound on cotton. Maybe we can get them pacified, at least I hope,we can. Joe Robinson, you know, is one of them.\n\n                          Johnson has quit talking now and Connally and Pittman are having an argument with Gore as a sharpshooter. I've got to get Bennett to New York if I can.\n\n                          Kiss my baby and I'll see you as soon as the wheels will let me arrive after this show quits.

My only regret is that it was not done ten years sooner. I hope Red Sands did his duty today. You really don't deserve a letter or a telegram or any flowers. I only got a [underlined] postcard [/underlined] and an answering telegram.\n\n                  I am going to punish you by not mailing this until tomorrow morning. I have found time to think of you and write you every day. I wonder if you are now or ever have been sorry you did it on June 28, 1919. You see you have been married to a financial failure and the reason for that is that I have al-,ways believed in doing as I'd be done by, and to make money and keep it you must be a pirate or strike an oil well or a gold mine. Had I not been a fool patriot in 1917, I'd had the oil well. And maybe would have turned pirate and been successful. I am hoping to make a reputation as a Senator, though if I live long enough that'll make the money successes look like cheese. But you'll have to put up with a lot if I do it because I won't sell influence and I'm perfectly willing to be cussed if I'm right.\n\n                  I've never had but one golden-haired, blue-eyed sweetheart and she's still the same blue-eyed, but now maybe silver-haired, sweetheart and just as perfect and as beautiful as I dreamed of when,[letterhead]                                  \nHarry S.

The Senate recessed at five-thirty yesterday to Monday. I could have made the New York trip but didn't do it because Harrison invited me to a meeting at Kennedy's house at seven o'clock this evening. Kennedy runs the Securities Commission and I ought to know him.\n\n            I told the girls they needn't come back tomorrow but I think they are coming any way. They treat me just like you do.\n\n           Hopkins asked me to come by his office on my way home and he showed,me a letter where my good friend Mrs. Mary Edna Cruzen had asked all the people in the employment office in St. Louis to contribute [scratched out] d [/scratched out]  to the Democratic Campaign fund . She'd sent 'em a circular letter--a penitentiary offence. You know I spent the better part of my time as Employment Director keeping her in good here in Washington. She's overturned the apple cart sure enough now. Hopkins and Miss Perkins wanted me to fix it up and I guess I'll have to do it.\n\n                   You should be glad you're home--it's hot as blazes here--but I wish you were here. I hope I get more than a post card tomorrow. Messall said he'd bring the dish home before Sunday.

Huey and Bone and most everyone are trying to make him ridiculous and without success. Tydings has a most peculiar complex. He's a most selfish and egotistical,person. I don't know which is more insincere, Tydings or Huey. I urged Huey to jump him about the ship subsidy, a bill Tydings is for, one of the worst pieces of graft in the history of the country. But Tydings I think was attorney for a banking outfit, interested in starting a ship line from Baltimore to several European ports by having Uncle Sam pay the bill. The government spent some six or seven millions on the project, and Mr. Morgan and Kermit Roosevelt seem to have been the only ones who made a profit. But he's against flood control in the Mississippi Valley. I don't like him. He's not on the level. But he's having a good time and the galleries are laughing. He's even pulverized Huey, which is something even if he is wrong. We'll pass the bill anyway. Tomorrow we get done. I go to N.Y.,with Bennett and start home on Sunday afternoon. That ought to put me there Tuesday, as I said this morning.\n\nHope my daughter is recovering from her accident. I'll forgive her for not writing since she was crippled. Kiss her for me.

I am returning Lucy's letter. I'm glad to know who Mrs. Keene was. They were just taking a trip. Went to N.Y. from here and on to Canada. Belated honeymoon, I guess.\n\nI think it will be all right to let Margaret take August off from her music. I am sorry about Mrs. Story's attitude. But you never in your life saw one who would give another music teacher any credit. My paper slips around on this desk leaf so I can hardly write. The center is so full I can't find,room on it. I haven't heard from McGee but I got the Woolf check back. Go ahead and have your room papered and buy any bargains you see in dishes etc. Let them ship 'em to the office. They'll be less likely to break. I'll find some place to live before I'm through and it'll be all right. I think the Highlands is fireproof. The halls don't smell nice but the apartments are very nice. I have been at the office since eight o'clock. The mail just came and so did you Friday letter. I am enclosing you one from Garfinkel's. I thought it was a receipt for the check I sent them when I opened it. John and Harry and this fellow Mc something or other and the Warrensburg Pitcher with St. Louis came in to see me,[letterhead]                                                                                  Harry S.

The boys are coming back and we're going to a sixty cent lunch over here at Chiles. I was supposed to go to dinner with Geo R. Collins last night but I called up and begged off. Went to bed instead. He was the Captain of B Bty when I joined it in 1905. A nice old man but I'd had dinners enough for one week.\n\n                       The Senate met at 10 A.M. yesterday and stayed on the job until a quarter to three. That gave Jack and his ball fans a chance to get to the game. We only disposed of one amendment. There are still some four,hundred pending. That's the A.A.A. I don't suppose they'll consider over a dozen more and that may take all week. Then the deficiency bill, the bank bill, transportation, Guffey Coal, and tax. Labor Day is the earliest possible moment I guess.\n\n              Jane and Mildred took yesterday off and went to Atlantic City for the weekend. That's the reason my desk is so full. But they'd been working hard and I couldn't say no. It's hot as blazes here. Sorry you didn't get the Bella Vista trip. Hope the Nolands got off. Nellie wrote me but I didn't get it answered. Kiss Margey.  Love to you both \nNice of the Shields to ask you.

I am starting on it early this time and I can start early because your letter was in the first mail. We got the bill past the Audit and Control Committee to keep our extra clerk and so Catharine can stay on. We surely need her too. Glad you heard from the Boxleys. I think I told you I had a letter from him, from the Hotel Cumberland, London, W.I. He seemed to be in fairly good health and,spirits for him. I guess I left the ten in the shirt. You should give the girl half and you keep the rest. I'd forgotten all about it. You see I need a guardian worse every day. Canfil wired me he had my office all fixed up in the new Court House.\n\n                      We'll start driving as soon as I get home and end up somewhere. We might go to Des Moines the first day. Madison Wis the second and Green Bay or Milwaukee the third and then take a boat ride or drive to Minneapolis and back by way of Sioux City and Lincoln Neb; or just go to Bella Vista and sleep.  Kiss my baby.

Now can you beat that. I'd better go out and get a place to live right away and bring you all back here Sept 1st if that's what is to happen. I don't believe it will.\n\n               I sat here yesterday and wrote you a nice long letter and was getting ready to go over and mail it when a bunch of people from Camp Meade came in and wanted me to go to Gettysburg and explain the battle to them. Well I went and left a note on the door,for Johnny telling him I'd run out on the Sunday lunch and walked off and forgot to mail your letter. It was staring me in the face when I got back at six o'clock and I took it over and mailed it. But I fear it was too late to arrive on time. I tried to call you up from 8:30 to 9:15 but could get no answer. I suppose you'd gone driving or were in the back yard and didn't hear the phone. It rained very hard at Gettysburg but hadn't rained in Washington when I got back. We sat in the car until it let up and then did the battle again. I can get a job as a guide when I'm through being Senator. I guess I'll go apartment hunting again tomorrow. The Senate meets at ten and I can't today. I hoping for a letter.

Went out to Leighton Sheild's last night with Messall and had a nice dinner. Was fool enough to drink a little cup of black coffee. So I woke up at 4 A.M. Got up at 5:30 and took Clark Buckner to breakfast at seven. It was pouring down rain and we took a taxi for two blocks to the office. He stayed and talked to me until the Senate met which was at,eleven o'clock. Then everybody and his brother kept calling me out and I didn't get the letter written. It is six o'clock and after now, and Ristine and Tom Graves just called up and said they'd be over to see me.\n\n                  Well they are gone and it's 6:30. I'll take this over to the P.O. and mail it. The Guffey Bill has jammed the works and we won't get done until Saturday. You be ready though and we'll start somewhere as soon as we can leave. I ought to be home by Monday or Tuesday.

I appreciate your going to town to mail the one that came yesterday. I'll tell you about the Lafayette Hotel. You asked me that before but I keep forgetting to tell you. I have a room on the 8th floor No 804. It fronts on 16th Street and has a bay window so I get the south breeze; there is a fine large bathroom with tub and shower. The bathroom door has a long mirror in it; two big closets - one big one and one ordinary hotel size.,Then I have a dresser, chiffoneer [sic] and a dressing table, all with mirrors. I have to turn 'em up or down when I'm in the room because there's too much reflection. They are very nice to me at the hotel. I never ask for anything but I never have to. If you were here and my daughter I'd have everything I need. I didn't get to go apartment hunting today. I'll have to wait until Sunday.\n\n             I guess I'd better detail my social engagements of this week. They all piled up at once. I told you I had dinner with Keene and wife Monday at the Lafayette and that Louis McGee son of Tommy and Jerome,[letterhead]                                                                                     Harry S.

Tuesday I went to Leighton Sheilds. No one but me and they had a delightful dinner. He was sober and we only had one mint julep - you can't beat that. Last night I had dinner with old Col Strickler. Mr. Lynn the Capitol Architect and one of the D.C. Judges were the other guests. It was a nice dinner too. I left there at a quarter to nine and went out to the Maryland Club to appear at a meeting of the Young Dem's of D.C. who gave a dinner in honor of the Mo delegation. Got home at,eleven o'clock after I'd been approached by at least a dozen who wanted letters for jobs. The Duncan's were there and Zimmerman and one or two other Congressmen. Clark didn't show up.\n\n             It news to me that Strickler had been married. How'd you find out? I'm surprised at Lou and I'm not either. He'll have quite a Harem in the next world won't he? I've got to review the C.M.T.C. troops at Ft. Meade today. There's no rest for the wicked. You don't know how much I appreciate your letter. Margey's came today too.

[/letterhead]  \nTuesday Aug 20 '35\n\nDear Bess:-\n                     Your Sunday letter came this morning and I was more ashamed than ever because my mind didn't work on Friday. I'm sure sorry to hear about Margaret's arm. I hope it will be all right. Maybe it was a help if the bone structure needed additional calcium. Her weight is all right anyway. Do you,suppose she'll ever quit growing tall? I imagine her sudden and fast growth caused the lack of chemical in her bones.\n\n                 I went to dinner with Judge Mitch Henderson, Cong. Duncan, Romjue and Hennings last night at the Carlton. It was rather damp and I left at 9:15 and was in bed at a quarter to ten. I am supposed to go to Lighton Sheilds again tonight. I think he wants to be an assistant Attorney General. I don't mind if he is and I guess I'll have to recommend him. Clark Buckner is in town attending a conference on the education and employment of the young people. He was made the Director from Missouri on the recommendation of the two Senators.,He's a fine man and will do the job. His name is Champ Clark Buckner and he is a cousin of Bennett's.\n\n                We are trying to get through, but it looks as if there'd be a filibuster on the Guffey coal bill. It may extend the session a couple of days. I want to be in Independence next Monday anyway and on the road somewhere the next day.  Kiss Margey.

She can be fired any time we need her. Mrs. Faris told me you had written her.\n\n             She wouldn't let me see the letter so I guess you must have said something nice about me. You are right about my having to give a party but I'm going to wait until next year to do it. It seems like a year since I was home and I guess it'll be two,before I get home. I'm not going to make any engagements for flats until I am sure they are what we want. I'd like very much to go back in our same building but not at a sacrifice like we did last year.\n\n                  I sent Bud out to look at the 19th St place and I'm going to see the Highlands one tomorrow if everything holds together. Ferguson was in this morning and said he had a job at $3600.00 in Sante Fe [sic]. Wish I had a job like that and could live in Sante Fe [sic].\n\n                   The House tried to pass a resolution today to adjourn July 23 but it failed. All the newspapers at home called me and wanted to know when I was ready to quit and I said May 15 would suit me fine. We are still working on A.A.A. and I guess we'll be the rest of the week. I have been asked to come to Ft. Meade and review the troops Thursday at 5:15 and have dinner with the officers. I think I'll go if the Senate isn't voting or some,thing else doesn't intervene.\n\n               Mrs. Roy McKittrick and her son, her brother in law and his wife and one of Mc's deputy's was in to see me this morning. She talks as much as Mrs. Bryan. I'd like to see Mrs. Bryan have a job. Friant has a nervous breakdown. He's improving but has the hiccoughs almost continually and bleeds at the back of his neck.

Meade last night or yesterday afternoon rather and the commandant sent me a Major for an aide and a sergeant for an orderly. The Major's name was Jim Corbett a Republican reserve officer from Pittsburgh Pa. He was a scream. I reviewed the C.M.T.C boys some 3000 of them, inspected kitchens and street, had a grand dinner with the officers at the Club and got home at ten o'clock. I was in bed at ten.

Mr. Rust is coming to see me again this morning about the 16th and P St place where the Smiths live. Said he had a plan for the remodeling, which I'll send you if he'll let me have it. I haven't had a chance to look anymore since the other day I wrote you about but I'm hoping I can go either tomorrow or Sunday. I wish you were here to look with me. It would be a lot easier.

I have the picture of my show girl on the desk and everybody sees her. Nearly everyone says she'll make me famous some day and I'll bet she does. It must have been a grand show. I wish I could have seen it.\n\n               I know you had a grand time at Arrow Rock and I wish I could go to Bella Vista with you. I know you'll have a grand time. Vivian is a peculiar person. He's built on a [triaid?] and touchy place but his heart is right. He just takes it for granted you hear from me every day and,he sees no reason for repeating. Then he's not the politician you old man is either which makes a difference. But he's my brother and I take him for what he is not for what he does. I feel the same way about every member of both of our families. I like 'em all because they are who they are.\n\n               I have been out apartment looking this morning. The one at 1821 Nineteenth was directly across from the school but wouldn't do. They were remodeling an old house - one of the three-story kind - and making an apartment of each floor. No private entrance or anything.\n\n               There was one at 1726 Massachusetts that's a dandy but the rent's too much. It had a grand hall, living,[letterhead]                                                                     Harry S.

[/letterhead] \n\nroom and dining room, two bedrooms, two baths, and closets galore, two-car garage and a Missouri nigger for a janitor - graduate of Lincoln University at Jefferson City. They asked $160 per month. I fell out of there in a hurry. Found a rather nice place at 1921 Kalorama Road. It was a northwest corner, fifth-floor apartment - two bedrooms, two baths, living room, small dining room, large hall, $125 per month. No garage. Then I looked at a house at 2218 Cathedral, a block north of Connecticut. It was a house like Pete Allen's. They were painting and papering it from cellar to attic. It had a two-car garage and was just,the same size and kind as Pete's house. They wanted $90 per month. I then went down to the Highlands at California and Connecticut. They had a nice two-bedroom apartment on the southeast corner, fourth floor, at $125 - better I think than 1921 Kalorama Road. Then I looked at the Westmoreland, right behind the Highlands on California. They wanted $100 for a two-bedroom apartment on sixth floor, and $79.50 for one on fourth floor that had four rooms. It is an old place but the location and rooms were very nice. You'll notice that all these places are within two or three blocks of the school. I am going to look at 2400 Sixteenth Street and the Jefferson tomorrow and a couple of houses. I bet I find something that'll suit before I quit. Margey owes me a letter. Kiss her anyway.

Arrived at Mrs. Robie's place at about eleven o'clock, went swimming, and then had a grand lunch. The outfit all went riding in a big motorboat except Bud and Mrs. Bud, Mrs. Messall, and me and Harry Salisbury. I went to sleep and didn't get up until 5:00 P.M. Bud and his wife went home and,the boat riders came back and had a ball game until dark, shot firecrackers, and we came home arriving about nine-thirty. I was in bed by ten and slept like a log. There won't be any session of the Senate until Monday. I wish I'd started home at noon on Tuesday. I could have been in Independence Wednesday evening and started back Saturday. Of course it would have been a very strenuous drive - I could have done it however. They say though that after fifty, things like that ought not to be done.

Gen. and of Ewell who succeeded Stonewall Jackson in command of the famous Confederate II Corps. I wish I'd brought Old Longstreets book with me. You know he had the I Corps and did get into position until the,third day of the battle. His failure to arrive at Chancelorsville kept that from being a second Cannae.\n\n                   I wish you were here to go along. Hope you won't have to be in such a hurry next time.

In my opinion it's almost as good as the Broadmoor at two hundred dollars and twice as nice as last winter.

Instead of writing it this morning and mailing it as I usually do at the P.O. as I leave the office I waited until we got home from Gettysburg.\n\n                We left about 8:30 and drove down highway #50 to U.S. 15 in Virginia and then drove up and crossed the Potomac about ten miles north of Leesburg where J.E.B. Stuart crossed with his cavalry division on the Pennsylvania campaign. We got to Gettysburg at eleven o'clock and started in with the first days positions on the,Union side north of town. The War College sent me three maps - one for each day of the battle so we had all the information. I had Dr. Freeman's book along to so we really fought the battle correctly from start to finish. Cussed Longstreet thoroughly, relieved Ewell and reprimanded Stuart. Walked over Pickett's charge and really had a grand time. There are a number of towers over the field - five in all each just 96 steps high. We climbed them all and of course the legs ache somewhat tonight. I wish you and Margaret could have been along. I could see both armies,in action as plainly as if they'd been there. You know it's one of the world's 15 decisive battles, but neither side won. It merely stopped Lee's invasion of the North.\n\n                 I am sending you a cartoon of the Congress. It looks as if we are stuck for July anyway. I am still looking for Margey's letter. I am rather tired so I'll have to quit. John, Harry, and a boy who rooms with them went along.

I got all lonesome last night and wanted to call you up but my toll bill for last month was so big I resisted the urge. Clark & I called Park on July 6 and talked a tremendous bill which I had to pay. Then we didn't accomplish any thing. So I went to the Fox instead of calling you. The show was rotten maybe because I was thinking of home all the time. Harry Salisbury is here in the office this morning. He looks rather pale but otherwise,he's O.K. He and John are coming home with me.\n\n                It was an awful accident in Alaska and of course we can't see the why. But I'd rather be put out at the top of my career than to come down the ladder and die of remorse. No one has done more to give us common sense than Will Rogers. He's almost a second Mark Twain. The world is better for having produced him. I'm glad his mother didn't believe in birth control.\n\n               I am hoping to see you Sunday or Monday and then we'll pull out for somewhere for a couple of weeks.

I am sorry I made a mistake going to the office picnic. It never occurred to me that there would be anything wrong with it. The same people who were there before came and the same things were done. I had a saltwater swim and a good nap and felt fine after it was over. John I guess told his mother that I'd gotten over the blues,somewhat I guess. You shouldn't take a piece of idle gossip and try to twist it into something unpleasant. Mrs. Griggs you know likes to give people the worst motives. I am on the point of increasing Johnnie's pay from $120 to $135, but if he's going to become a gossip about me I'll be hanged if I'll do it. Probably my letter on finances made you feel badly. I am sorry if it did. I sent Woolf Bros. a check for $55.25. I guess they'll send it back. I am enclosing you another $100.00 to pay for the auto. I forgot all about it.\n\n                         I suppose Mrs. Griggs' remark makes you curious about my evenings. Well I've been reading the Bank Bill, the Social Security Bill, Water Carrier Bill, and Freeman's Lee at night as well as the New York Times. Been to see one show - H. Rider Haggard's \"She.\" It was very good. I wanted to see Joe Brown in Alibi Ike but didn't. I went to dinner with Clark and Sid Stephens,Saturday and Mrs. Clark at the Shoreham. Saw Mrs. Cochran and Jack. Got home at ten-thirty even then. I am to have dinner with assistant manager of Pennsylvania Railroad tonight and that's all I have on for this week. So I guess I'll finish Freeman's volume one. You sort of gave me a blue feeling again. I'll be glad when this damned session is over.

It's hotter than Tophet here. Some prostrations every day. I think however that prostrations are sometimes laid to heat when they'd happen anyway.\n\n                     I'd like to go to Santa Fe with Frank and Natalie but we'd better figure out a trip and take it. You know how they do. Right at the last minute something will happen and they won't go. Which way do you want to go? North,West, or South? East is out. We won't go in that direction. How'd you like to go to the Surf Hotel in Chicago for a week and ride up to Milwaukee on a boat? Or go to Duluth, Minnesota, and do the same thing? Or go to Estes Park and stay a week or two? We won't leave our daughter at home. That's final. Maybe you'd prefer Bella Vista or Van Buren or Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Hot Springs isn't bad you know. At least have some preferences by the time I get there, which will be about the twenty-sixth of August and we'll pull right out. You know if I get started at home I can't get away. Hope your cool weather holds. Kiss Margey.

I paid Garfinckel and Jelleff and Woolf Bros., so we haven't anything staring us in the face now but the one insurance account at McGee's and my government policy, which I can pay August 1 and still be all right. You're absolutely right about not eating and wearing clothes. I guess if we'd go to one of these camps where they wear no clothes, we,might get ahead on the clothes account but it would be worse when we came out because we'd have no old ones to fall back on.\n\n                    I went to the Hotel at 2:30 yesterday and spent the afternoon reading the bank bill. Read some of it three times and am still in doubt about exactly what it means. You can see why courts are a necessity.\n\n                    E. Sidney Stephens came to see me and discussed the employment set up in Missouri. I am hoping to get it straightened out by tonight.

It would certainly be grand. I don't know what I wouldn't give to see you. The best information now is August 1st. I am most anxious to get done and away.

The Sunday Star came yesterday and I was very glad to see it. I guess Margey will be lost without her playmate. Maybe she'll practice more.\n\nI haven't been anywhere this week and I have no engagements! Don't expect to make any. If the Senate Adjourns Friday I may drive to New York to see Pendergast. But no one will know of it and you'll receive a letter or wire,if I do it.\n\n                    We finished the A.A.A. yesterday after more than two weeks debate and I have come to the conclusion that the debate helped the bill so it wasn't time wasted after all. I got sick of it but learned a lot by listening. I am of the opinion that the unconstitutional part of the old act has been substantially cured. That seems to be the opinion of Borah and Norris and Bailey of North Carolina who are constitutional lawyers. Ashurst of Arizona however thinks otherwise and voted against the bill. Bankhead told me that he'd gone high tariff on account of Arizona copper. I hate to believe that. I'd rather think he voted against the AAA because he,[letterhead]                                                                               \nHarry S. Truman\nIndependence, Mo.

I hope we get a good one.\n\nIt's hot as blazes this morning and is going to rain. I am hoping for a letter on the first mail.

I was up at 6:30, had breakfast at 7:30, and I'm down at the office now waiting for the picnickers to come. They were to be here at eight but I expect nine or nine-thirty will about hit them. I was extravagant yesterday and bought a swimming suit. Probably won't put it on. But I thought I'd better have it along. I am thinking of going over to Annapolis tomorrow and sleeping off about twenty-four hours. Senator Lonergan told me that there is a nice cheap, reasonable beach close there. I probably won't go when,the expense stares me in the face. The best thing I can do would be to stay here at the office and write a half-dozen speeches on various subjects and be ready for the homecoming.\n\n               I am going to prepare one on farming and foreign trade, one on social security, one on the Bank Bill, one on bureaucratic government, and if Mr. Reed gets too smart I'm thinking of telling what I know about him.\n\n               I had to sit in the chair all yesterday afternoon and say, \"Without objection the amendment is agreed to.\" The bill was the water transportation regulation one and there,were from two to ten amendments on every page - there were seventy-odd pages so you see I had a very pleasant time. Copeland and Huey and Shipstead got into arguments with Wheeler but I had no ruling to make. I am having the record sent to the house, thought maybe you'd like to have some more wastepaper around.\n\n             It has been a round of funerals hasn't it? I'm glad you sent Mize a nice remembrance for his mother. How did it happen? And who did it?\n\n             You know when you pass fifty,all you do is go to funerals of your friends.\n\n              Tell Bill Southern he owes me a letter. Is he mad or something? I got a dandy from Heinie yesterday. I'd threatened him with an investigation and he said I'd better have it done before I got home or I'd be a part of the investigated.\n\n             Tell Margie I'm still looking for that letter. You can give her a kiss anyhow.\n\n                                          Love to you  \n                                                 Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C.

I forgot to put a special delivery on yesterday's rotten effort so you won't get it Sunday. Somehow or other my head wouldn't work and it ached most of the day. It's all right this morning. You might draw the conclusion that I'd had a night of it at Ft. Meade but I didn't. I think standing in the sun 45 minutes without moving except to salute the colors and the Star Spangled Banner, maybe,had something to do with it. They asked me if I wanted to take the parade and if I'd said no they'd thought I couldn't take it. I stood on the right of the regimental commander, which isn't done usually.\n\n                I went to dinner with Riley Simrall last night. His wife is a very nice woman. She had the same sort of job as Florence Corbin[?]. She wanted to know if Florence and Charlie had gotten married yet. She got the dinner herself and it was very good.

Truman\n Independence, Mo. [/letterhead]\n\ncroft is a dead end street and their apartment is the last one on the street toward Connecticut. Some legation owns the land across the street and it is a park. Mrs. Wilson's house is on S Street across the park and a lot of other high hats. Their apartment has two bedrooms, two baths, living room, dining room and kitchen but it is not a nice arrangement. It rents unfurnished for $110.00 and it's only three blocks from the school. The owner is going to make me a proposition on it. I am enclosing the Rust apart-,ment where the Smiths live as they propose to cut it. Both will front on 16th St. facing east. The best one will be on P Street on the north and will have two bedrooms and two baths. The one on the court will have two bedrooms and one bath. The court rents for 90.00 and the P Street side for 125.00. We may get them to come down somewhat I don't know. The other enclosure is the Presidential at 1016 16th St. It rents for $125.00 and has one bath. I am going to look some more Sunday I think if I don't sleep all day.\n\n               Kiss Margey - she owes dad a letter. Love to you both.

I studied the situation over and decided that maybe the Continental would be too handy for people to find me and also there are one or two Senators who live there and who like,the flowing bowl rather well so I thought I'd take the Lafayette. And besides they gave Stonebreaker a job after the Hamilton had fired him and I felt obligated.\n\n                      Paul Dillon came in to see me at 7:30 this morning and Mrs. Cruzen was in just as I left to see Mr. Prawl the Chairman of the Communications Commission in the interest of K.M.B.C. and Henry Chiles.,The old lady is in bad with the Dept of labor because of an indiscreet letter she sent out on campaign funds. Clark has taken her to task about it, but I'm not going to jump at her about it, although as usual she's put herself and the Missouri administration in a bad light here. Paul Dillon is all worried about the St. Louis situation and Matt Murray. They are in the midst of a big fight down there. Igor and the Mayor are fighting and I can't worry much. Mr. Church of Independence running K.M.B.C. got cited for fake advertising and I had to ask for leniency for him and I think I got it for him. Well it'll be a grand day no matter how hot.

We are having a hot wave. Yesterday and today and the day before were scorchers. I guess your hot wave came over here and you received a cool one from Alaska. At least that's the way the weather map looks.\n\nHarry Salisbury was moved to his boarding house yesterday.,He seems to be doing fine. I was over to see him last night. We now have another invalid in town and on our hands, one William Dryden. He's made Mildred believe that he's in bad shape and she's all sorry for him and I guess I'll have to help her out with him. I went up to see him this morning and he was tickled to death. He'd made all of them believe he'd had a heatstroke. I said, \"Bill, how much hootch did it take to give you this stroke?\" And he said he only had one drink he could remember. Of course I won't tell Mildred. Let her think well of him. I like him but he's like all the rest of the alcoholics - undependable.\n\nMr. LaFollette is making a speech on the tax bill and most of us are in the cloak rooms waiting for his finish. He has some nutty ideas on taxation that have a lot of merit,but I don't think I'll vote with him.

I'm glad you saw Mamma and Mary and that they were feeling well. I'm looking for letters. Kiss Margey.

C.    [/letterhead] July 2, 1935\n\nDear Bess:-\n\nI haven't had a letter today but I'm hoping for one in the last mail. Vivian came in last night from West Point. He and Everett Miller were together. They got Fred all settled at the school and then drove down here. They got in about 8:30. I had a very pleasant visit with them, showed them the capitol, Library, Supreme Court, paid a visit to Bell and Shannon gave them a lunch in the Senate lunch room and started them home. I think they enjoyed it,very much.\n\n                   The Senate has been very busy trying to pass an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. Hughie has made three speeches - one of four hours, the others not so long. Sen Moore of N.J. had to make a speech because he was chairman of the subcommittee. He made the first new Senator speech. Tydings made one, Clark, Pittman and Borah all had something to say.\n\n                    Moore has invited all the new Senators to Atlantic City for the coming weekend. I am hoping to be able to go. Guffey is furnishing a special car to take us over and,bring us back. It ought to be an enjoyable time. The office force will have a picnic at the same place we all did before, and I guess I'll go, on the Fourth. Wish you were here. I got the box moved down today and Nettie is washing some sheets to put into it now and that'll wind things up for the moving business. I had Jane go uptown the other day and buy me a frame for your picture to set on the mantel. She did a very good job of it. You sort of dominate the office in that frame.\n\n                       Hope everybody is well and happy. I was sure sorry to hear of Mize's mother. Sent him a telegram. It sure looks like the McCoy's were having all the bad luck at once. Pendergast's daughter-in-law is fond of \"lovely.\" At least she wrote and that's more than the daughter did.\n\n                    Kiss my baby and I'll look for a letter tomorrow.

Yesterday I got a letter and this morning there was one in the first mail this morning. It makes the day brighter and cooler. Yesterday it was ninety-eight, but a big rain came up about six-thirty just as I got into the hotel. It was nice and cool all night. Wouldn't I look fine in a rain-soaked Palm Beach? But I beat it in. Mildred had bad,luck yesterday. The good-for-nothing Dryden man went crazy on a bus over at Leesburg, Virginia, and it took all the police of the town to take care of him. Messall and Mildred and a capital policeman went after him, and he's now in the emergency hospital. They say he wasn't drunk but a heat victim. I am skeptical about it. It put Mildred out of commission of course. I'd throw him in the Potomac if I had my way.\n\nI'm glad you went to see Mary on her birthday. She'll appreciate it. I'm hoping to be home in two weeks. Kiss Margey.

Just as I started to write once in the Senate, Pittman asked me to preside and I got stuck there until 3 o'clock. Then John took me up town to buy a swimming suit for him and me for tomorrow and here it is four o'clock. I guess we'll have a nice picnic. The Atlantic City proposition is called off because nearly all the Senators had to make 4th of July speeches.\n\n            I am glad you're not sorry that you took the plunge sixteen years ago. Just for that I'll have to talk sordid things in this letter.,I have a bill from Woolf's for $55.00, one from Jelleff's for $53.20, one from Garfinckel's for $55.85, and the grocery people sent me one for $9.53. If you say these are all right, I'll pay them but I'll wait until I hear from you. I am sending you a draft Friday for $200 and if you need more I'll send more. I'll have to have about $150-$175 for room rent and at least that much for laundry and meals; as nearly as I can figure we ought to be about $150 or $200 to the good at the end of this month, and next month if I get home we can beat it a couple of hundred more and perhaps get enough ahead to get furniture and fixtures for next year.,[letterhead]                                                                           Harry S.

[/letterhead] \n\n           I guess we ought to be happy we have no doctors bills and all of us are well. If I made everybody I've gotten jobs for since 1927 pay me by the month as Bulger used to, we'd have a nice tidy sum to the leeward every month, but I'm just a d.f. I guess I can't take it that way.\n\n           I'd have sent you the draft today but I couldn't get anybody to go uptown for me in time. The darned banks close at 2:00 P.M. you know.\n\n           I hope you are cool and happy and having a good time.,I'm sorry to talk money and bills and I wouldn't if I were a millionaire.\n\n             I walk down to Pennsylvania Avenue and eat breakfast - usually at Child's. Everything is all right at Drain's. I told you that Leonard said he'd give us an apartment at a special price next year. I leave my car in the Senate garage and ride the bus or cab. Either one is twenty cents.\n\n             I have Mrs. Drain's dish on my desk and will send it home tonight by Vic. Please write every day. Your Sunday note came after I'd mailed your letter yesterday. I got a nice one today as you can see.

And I've had more customers from Mo. than ever too. Jim Dougherty, my old supply sergeant in the army was in to see me yesterday and took me out to his uncles for dinner last night. The first time I've been out. Today Howard Hall was in to see me with one of his daughters. She's,fourteen and looks older. She looks like her mother and is very nice. We had lunch in the Senate dining room and she got as much kick out of it as if she'd been to Hollywood. Clark had up an amendment to the liquor control bill to allow the sale in barrels as well as bottles. It was defeated by 59 to 24. He and I are going to see Hopkins at 5:15 to talk about Murray. Someone has been knocking him and these bureaucrats have to be sold over. I am finally moved into the Continental to stay.

Nettie came out and cleaned up at three o'clock and I am in transit to a new roost. I am waiting for the manager of the LaFayette Hotel to call me. If he doesn't do it pretty soon I am going on over to the Continental. Yesterday was a very busy day. I dictated as many letters as usual and then took a couple of the boys whom Colonel Hickman had put to work out to dinner, and after I got rid of them I went out to Harry Hawes' house to another dinner and a meeting of the \"Hound Dogs.\" Marvin McIntyre, secretary to the Pres.,was there as was the Minister to Costa Rica, in whose honor the party was given. We played five-cent poker and I won five dollars, the Costa Rican Minister lost ten and he screamed like a Jewish merchant. He is a Jew I think. At least he looks and talks like one.\n\n                      I slept until 9:00 A.M. and then packed up. Some job. I had to do a lot of squeezing but got it all in after a fashion. The laundry ruined my linen suit - the double-breasted one I got in Baltimore. They put two red stains on the front of it and pinned a note on saying they had cleaned it twice and couldn't get 'em out. I'd only worn it in the Senate and there were no stains on it when I sent it. I,[letterhead]                                                                                  Harry S.

Leo Spalding had the ones from Kansas City in charge. They were very nice looking kids and I guess they'll have a grand time.\n\n                    I got no letter today but maybe I'll get two tomorrow.\n\n                     It's a terrible day when I don't get one.

Your letter was in the first mail. You tell Heinie if he doesn't do better, I'll still pull that investigation. I see Julian Friant's boy every day and he keeps me informed. He said yesterday that his dad was much better. Yes, Mr. Ferguson has been to see me and I have been trying to help him. Tom Miller from California is also here trying to get a job. He wants wholesale help - brought his brother along - and both want me to put them right with McAdoo and Johnson, neither one of whom[scratched out]e [/scratched out]  they know. If you don't think that was a diplomatic,job you're mistaken. I finally sent them on their way rejoicing without doing anything. You know I never saw Tom Miller but once before in my life and he was so busily engaged in making love to the Swope girl that he didn't see me then. It's too bad sometimes to have such a good memory.\n\n                 I couldn't keep from calling you last night and sure wished I was home. Hope you had a pleasant wedding day without the principal necessity for a wedding, to wit: a husband.\n\n                  The party last night was a real affair: Harrison, Hayden, Bankhead, Walsh, who'd bust if a pin were stuck into him, Pittman, Duffy, Connally, Lonergan of Connecticut, and one or two others whom I can't remember - Bilbo, Burke, and,[letterhead]                                                                                                          Harry S. Truman\n                                                                                                                               Independence, Mo. [/letterhead]\n\nI were the only new ones there. It is the finest home I've seen. Out west of Washington on the Potomac, a grand big house a half mile from the road in virgin forest with a Brussels carpet lawn of five acres all around it, a swimming pool in the yard, and all the other trimmings. There is a motion picture theater in the sub-basement. It was built by a young Chicago millionaire at a cost of $600,000, then he drank himself to death in two years, and his chorus-girl widow is trying to borrow $40,000 on it and can't. Kennedy has it leased, furniture and all, and it is a,grand place. I was complimented to be included in the party, and it did me no harm.\n\n             People are still calling on you. Here are some cards that have accumulated.\n\n             Tim Moran was just in to see me. He's on a long summer tour with his wife and child. They're going to Canada and Glacier Park Montana before going home. That'll be some trip.\n\n              Hope it's not as hot out there as it is here. Haven't made up my mind yet whether I'll go to the LaFayette or the Continental.\n\n              Lots of love to you and Margie\n                                            Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C. 2 JUN 29 5 PM 1935\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\n\n\n                                                              Mrs. Harry S.

I was so devilishly homesick - I could see you standing out there in the yard watching me drive away and I don't think you kissed me good-bye, or you can put it around the,other way if you want me on the defensive. Then I didn't call you from Richmond but it was so late when we got there and I didn't write from there either. We had a very strenuous trip what with high-water detours and what not, and I found Harry Salisbury being taken to the hospital as soon as we arrived. They operated on him for appendicitis about an hour after I called you. I was over to see him with Johnnie this morning and he was doing fine. Doctor said he could go home Wednesday. I sent his dad a wire this morning telling him about it and that Harry is getting along all right.,When I come home next time we are going to take a week's vacation and then maybe I can see you more than twice. I like the Continental and probably with a change or two will stay. You don't know how handy it is. Kiss Margey and tell her to write me a letter. I'm getting this off in a hurry.\n                                                                                                                                                                Love to you, Harry,[printed] Senate Chamber  [/printed]                              \n                                                             [circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C.

I see the reason I didn't get it yesterday. You didn't send me one Friday. Well I haven't missed yet but I may next Friday. I have to go to Schenectady N.Y. and make a radio speech at 8:15 E.S.T., that will probably be 6:15 right time in Independence. It will be over the station of the Gen. Electric Company and about the farm situation. Now beat that. I'm glad you are,having such a good hectic time that means we can't stay there all summer. They'll put us both to bed. I'll have to go around over the state for about a month and then we'll dig out either to Mississippi or San Diego. There are dozens and dozens of places for rent cheap now and I think I'll look at some of them. We might want to come back before Jan 1. If we could save any money it would be proper to do it. I'll write you a better one tomorrow. I'm going to see Cochran. Kiss Margie.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                Love to you Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C. 3 JUN 24 1230 PM 1935\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\n\n\n                                                              Mrs. Harry S.

No letter. I've a notion to call you tonight and reverse the charges after talking fifteen minutes. Your picture blew off the mantle yesterday and I'm somewhat superstitious so I had to call and see if it meant anything. It was a real relief to hear your voice.\n\n                I've called off the New York trip. With this tax business and all sorts of important things besides having to move I just couldn't make it. You also know it's a chore for me to write a speech and I won't,let anybody else do it. You remember Harvey would be so mad at me in the campaign because I wouldn't say what he wrote. Got a letter from Mary today said they were well and getting along. I had Nettie send my two white suits to the laundry yesterday. I hope I get them back on time. I am wearing white flannel britches and brown coat today. Have to go to dinner with Minton and all the new Senators tonight. If it stays as cool as it is now I won't have to go home and change.

I was sleeping good at 11:30 last night, went to bed at 9:30, when old man Jamison called me up. I had the phone reconnected and I wish I hadn't.

I've promised to take John and Harry over the Gettysburg battlefield Sunday and they will help me more when I get back.

It was most enjoyable to have them. The Times came too without my name on the list. I guess they all make mistakes and I happened to be the victim of this one. I know that Duke Shoop gave the fellow the names as they should be. I think the governor had a grand time. We all had dinner at the Occidental on Friday night, the governor, Caskie Collet, Sam Hargus, Bennett Clark, Duke Shoop, and two more whom I can't remember now. I went back to the office,at ten and signed my mail and then went to bed. They came down to my office Saturday at ten and as soon as Bennett arrived we took them to call on the Vice President and Senator Bachman and called up the White House, but the President was out of town so we didn't go up there only officially. We had lunch and then I left at 3 o'clock for New York. Wrote you from there and as soon as I got back.\n\n            I've had a very strenuous morning. The desk looked like a wreck even after I'd given Mildred a hundred letters Saturday and Jane as many today. But I'll catch up by tomorrow night if no more,[letterhead]                                                                             Harry S.

I got two more schoolboys jobs since coming back. Messall gets them and I get the credit. I brought another boy from St. Louis with me. He went to work this morning. He said that Leo Bird told somebody he came home with a Senator and that person wanted to know what place I played on the Washington ball team. Now beat that. I am,sending Margey the funnies from Washington papers of yesterday and a movie picture that looks like her. Please keep up the letters. You don't know how much I appreciate them. I have a letter from Fred Boxley at the Cumberland Hotel in London. He's not feeling very well but is improved over what he was when he left. Didn't say when he'd be back.\n\n              Kiss the baby, or Miss Margret rather.\n\n               Love to you both, Harry\n\nHere's Nettie's letter.

It was well above ninety. Along about seven o'clock the wind turned to the north and it became very cool. Murray and I went home at six thirty, washed my,face and hands and we went down to the Mayflower, met Mr. Griffith, who has Murray's job in Kansas and had dinner. We discussed all the ills of unemployment, relief and most everything else. About ten o'clock we went home and went to bed. I was too cold all night but too sleepy to get a blanket. Nettie writes me a note every day. She said you had sent her a letter in yesterday's note - seemed very much pleased over it. I am almost up to date again on mail. Yesterday and today were light in number.\n\n                    I went to the White House this morning with Clark and Cannon to talk to the President about,relief of flood sufferers, for whom Bennett had introduced a bill in the Senate and Cannon one in the House. I had a chance to tell Mr. Roosevelt what I thought of Mr. Mitchell. He very readily agreed with me. I am working as usual now but I'd do better if you and Margie were here.

I am somewhat disappointed that you don't look with favor on coming back. A sensible survey of the situation though would say you are right. I'm not sensible about it. I couldn't go to sleep until one-thirty thinking about you and home and Missouri in general. So of course I have a headache this morning. I got another letter this morning and one from Margey. That'll cure the headache. I won't,look at any more apartments until I see you. I am sure we can get lined up somewhere we'll like and I always think 3016 will be the place, although I haven't talked to Mr. Leonard.\n \n                      Pendergast was as pleased to see me as if I'd been young Jim. We talked for three hours about everything under the sun. Discarded a couple of prominent candidates for governor - canvassed all the rest and decided on nobody. I am going to get him to talk with Clark and me in about two weeks and I'll bet we can agree on someone. It won't be our dinner partner at Boxley's and it won't be the legal light of the Gov's cabinet.,[letterhead]                                                                     Harry S. Truman                         \n                                                                                            Independence, Mo. [/letterhead] \n\nThe trip to New York was a day's work both ways. Between Philadelphia and New York there are four lines of traffic and all four of them were full both ways both days. I left here at noon, picked up my boy in Ft. Meade and got to the New Yorker at 7:30. Can you imagine me taking seven hours to go 240 miles? I left there yesterday at 1:30 and got to my office at 8:30. So it can't be done in any shorter time at that time of day. We had no difficulty only we could drive just forty miles an hour like every body else did and when a truck got at the,head of the line it took a half hour to pass it.\n\n                   I am coming home Thursday if everything holds together. Make a speech at Agency - visit Stayton's camp and come back the following Friday. That'll give me time to see Murray, the governor, St Louis, and Springfield and maybe make things tick a little. I'll hate to come back without you. Kiss my baby.\n                                                                                                                                                                                    Love to you, Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 14 JUL 28 530PM 1935\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\n\n\n                                                              Mrs. Harry S.

Letters, letters, letters, all over my desk and everywhere else. Maybe when I go to hell they'll give me some other punishment and I won't have to answer letters to people who want what I can't give them.\n\n               Gates Wells and Bob Pulliam stayed all night at the apartment last night and so did Matt Murray. Nettie called up and I told her to fix up the beds which she did. We had a nice time. I took Gates and Bob to dinner at Harvey's after taking Murray to,the Mayflower to see Harry Hopkins with whom he had dinner. Murray was the only one of the 48 that had that honor. It looks as if we are really in good now.\n\n                  Jim Farley was eating at Harvey's and I got him to come over and shake hands with the boys. They said that after meeting both Hopkins and Farley they could go home and high hat everybody in Platte County, including the governor and Henry Dillingham.\n\n                  The Senators all pretended to miss me and were very cordial to me-so was the Vice President. He appreciated my contribution so much he wouldn't even [underlined] open [/underlined] it. Took it and locked it up and said he'd save it until he really had the stomach,[letterhead]                                                                              Harry S.

[/letterhead] \n\n-ache or some other fitting ailment for which there would be an excuse to use it.\n\nOld Mitchell is raising the roof here in Washington. All the papers had foot high headlines on him. I guess the administration will use more care next time.  I am sending you a check. I hope it will cover things, if not tell me about it. Do you think you can make out with it and three hundred after the first until August? If you can I'll get all insurance and everything paid up next month. If you don't think you can I can put,off some of them.\n\nHow's Margaret and the baby and everybody else? I wrote Margaret yesterday in the Senate while Huey was spouting.\n\nThe bell is ringing and I have to run. I'm looking for a letter tomorrow. It's a wrench to be without you. I never missed you so much before when I'd be away temporarily. Kiss my baby.\n\nLots of love, Harry,,"

I quit sending the laundry from the office. The hotel on regular service doesn't charge any more and it is handier. The Cosmopolitan came and that was a wonderful article about Mark. I was glad to get it.\n\n          I've quit looking for apartments. If you're not coming back I won't spend any more time at it,but I've learned a lot about how to do it. I believe we can find something agreeable. I'm going to come back early and spend the time looking and then find something we want. I still believe we'll be back in 3016 somewhere.\n\n                 The Senate may adjourn by August 25th. That won't be so bad. I'm expecting to see you Saturday if everything works out as it should. Then I'm going to spend the week straightening out the State. Be sure and kiss Margey.

Your letter dated Monday just now came and I was most glad to get it.\n\n                  I hope you had a nice time at the ball game and that you got your furniture fixed to suit you. I went up to Garfinkle's and got me two palm beach suits. They are very nice and very reasonable in price and fit me for a wonder. I also got a 95 cent straw hat. I'll be in Independence on,Friday night I hope. Then I'll have to go to Agency on Saturday and will be home Sunday. I'll see Mamma on Monday. Stay in Independence that night. Go to Springfield on Tuesday, Nevada on Wednesday, Jefferson City and Moberly on Thursday and Washington Saturday. New York on Sunday. How's that for a week?

He asked me over to dinner but I told him to wait until I moved down in town. Mrs. Clark asked me to come to dinner Saturday evening. I haven't seen Mrs. Duncan or Mrs. Sheilds. I called up Mrs. Swofford this morning and took Matt Murray to breakfast with her at that place where she lives on New York Ave. I wanted Murray to find out about the political women of Missouri and no other time was available. He and Clark and I have had a satisfactory understanding and Murray is now having lunch with the Congressmen over at the House restaurant. Murray is going home at 6:45,and I hope I can get to bed early and get a night's sleep. We have been sitting up discussing all the difficulties facing him. I hope we have them settled.\n\n                                  The rumor today is that we'll adjourn by the tenth. That's too good to be true. I'm hoping to see you as soon as possible.

I did tell Miss Margaret some things she should do both for herself and her mother, and I suspect she is studying them over before she shows you the letter.\n\n              I expected to go to bed early last night but didn't get there until 10:00 P.M. because I was fool enough to tell a fellow who holds a job in the Government Printing Office, who is a Missourian and who is the Master of a Lodge, that I'd come out and,talk to them. Since I'd run out on him on another occasion I had to go, but didn't stay late.\n\n                       The Senate had a session today so Huey could make a speech. Bennett and I went to a dinner, or lunch I guess would be better, for Bernarr McFadden, the editor of Liberty, and the owner of a lot of other magazines. All the Missouri Congressmen were there. He's quite an interesting old codger. Sixty-seven and still runs foot races and wrestles. Wrote one of those books Myra gave me on eyes. Runs a health hotel in northern New York.

John picked it out for me. They all seem to know what to do now when the mail comes in. I got Matt Murray out of town last night but didn't get to bed any sooner because Duke Shoup took me out to eat. His wife went to a bridge party and so he used me to fill in with.\n\n              Jane called up Mrs. Wooten.

I'll meet the,train any day.\n\n                  I called Mrs. Cochran this morning and she said Jack was much better and that she thought I could see him in a day or so. She seemed much pleased that I'd call her. Nettie comes every day and cleans up the house makes the beds washed my shirts and socks so I don't have any laundry. She is washing the sheets again today. I gave her $5.00 yesterday and she was pleased to death with it.\n\n                 I'll be there another week and then more. There's no use paying two lodging bills.

You are supposed to sow turnips today. There's no place for me to do it except in the court of the Senate Office Bldg and Garner probably would object.\n\n                 Six new white collar attached shirts came from Eddie's factory today or yesterday I don't know which. I just saw them. They have that new collar on them. I should keep clean now anyway. I'm going to get a couple of white suits while the sale is on and then I can run until,fall. I shouldn't have to buy any more clothes until 1941.\n\n               I went to dinner with Johnnie and Harry over at their boarding house last night and it was a very good dinner and just about enough to eat. Went home and went to bed at 8:30 read all the papers and was up at 5:45 as usual.\n\n               The Senate convenes at eleven o'clock today to consider the Banking Bill. Senator Nye of North Dakota spoke for four hours after he'd introduced Father Coughlin's bill as an amendment. The priest's campaign manager and the president of the American Bankers Assn sat,[letterhead]                                                                        Harry S.

Neither of course knew who the other was. Most of us thought Coughlin wrote Nye's speech. Nye is one of the good-looking, egotistical boys who play to the gallery all the time. He's had the limelight on the munitions investigation for six months and he never comes to the Senate except to make a speech or introduce a bill to abolish the army and navy or to get more money for more investigation and more publicity. Several so-called people's friends in the Senate would be in a hell of a fix if there were not some good old work horses,here who really cause the Senate to function. I can't pay much on Nye, LaFollett, Black of Alabama, and that brand. Wheeler and Bankhead of Alabama are workers. Wheeler isn't as radical as he's painted and I like him. Glass is a worker. So is Adams of Colorado, Harrison, Robinson, and one or two others. Robinson's gone high hat but he's a good worker nevertheless. On the Republican side, McNary, Shipstead, Hale and White, both from Maine, and the ex-prize fighter from New Jersey, Barbour, are the best workers. There isn't a so-called progressive who does anything but talk. Your letter just came. Glad you had a good time at Thelma's. There's rumor that August 15 is the day. I hope it is.

They have evidently failed to deliver it because it wasn't in the mail - a sore disappointment. I hope Miss Margaret had a fine party - I sent her a telegram.\n\nYou should have seen the Clark dinner. It was very nicely done. Ed Villmore called me up and I went to the Carlton to meet him and Stuart McDonald and went out in McDonald's car. Sen. Van Nuys of Ind. and his wife were there, Mrs. and Mr. Emil Hurja, a Mr. and Mrs. Cramer,he was formerly National Committeeman from Montana - is now a famous lobbyist. The representative of the Baltimore Sun here in Washington and his wife were there too I can't remember his name, as were Mr. and Mrs. Duke Shoop. After dinner Mrs. Clark, Mrs. Van Nuys, Stuart McDonald and Mr. Cramer played bridge. I forgot to mention that Senator Adams of Colorado was there too. He, Van Nuys, Hurja and his wife, Mrs. Cramer and the wife of the Baltimore Sun and myself play poker on the dining room table. I played for about an hour an a half and found that I was among experts and quit a quarter to the good, turned in my chips threw the quarter in the pot and talked,[letterhead]                                                                                      Harry S.

[/letterhead]\n\npolitics the rest of the evening with Bennett, Shoop and the Baltimore Sun man. While I won't admit that the poker sharks could out play me I didn't feel like I could lose twenty five dollars and I had no right to take the money if I couldn't lose it. I showed them a Missouri game or two they'd never seen and they enjoyed it.\n\n                     The Shoops brought me home at 2:35 A.M. I got up at nine thirty and have been down here since ten thirty. I'm going out and buy a dinner now and go out to the flat and sleep all afternoon. The mail is up to date and I am,hoping for a reasonably quiet week although I know I'm hoping in vain. There'll be some outfit here to worry us without a doubt.\n\n              I am hoping for a letter tomorrow. I hope I've answered all your questions. The laundry the pressing, and breakfast are all right. I'm not missing any of them although it's not so nice to do it myself. I'm glad you are getting caught up on sleep. I guess I never will.\n\n           Kiss my baby and keep writing.\n                                        Lots of love.

Your letter hasn't come today. I bent my specs and have had a headache for a couple of days. Got them straightened yesterday and will be all right today. I had intended going to N.Y. to see T.J. about some things at home but Chas. Howell wrote he was coming in today and I doubt if I get away. I went to a show last night it was so hot I couldn't sleep early so I ate dinner at a cafeteria over on K Street across from the Carlton and walked down to the,Earle. Dick Powell was the star in a show call Broadway Gondolier. It was a good show. I see one so seldom that they are all good to me. Got home at ten and was down here at 7:15 this morning.\n\n                              I wrote a letter for Mrs. Griggs to Mrs. Cole so I guess that'll stop her for a while and maybe put her to work.\n\n                              I am hoping for a letter on the next mail.\n\n                             Will do better next time.\n\n                            Kiss my baby and keep writing.\n                                      Love to you both, \n                                                                  Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C. 18 JUL 27 1-PM 1935\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\n\n\n                                                              Mrs. Harry S.

The two today make up for the loss yesterday.\n\n               I went to see Cochran Monday and had a very pleasant visit with him. He looked fine and said he was going fishing Saturday and rest all Summer and Fall and come back for the next session as good as new. Messall is home sick today but his wife said she thought he'd be on deck tomorrow.\n\n               Mr. Drain was in to see me this morning and I gave him a key. I told him to go out and,or have Mrs. Drain go out and see that Nettie got the right sheets and pillow cases. He wanted me to stay out there until I got ready to go home but I told him I couldn't afford it. He offered to let me stay for $125.00 but I told him I'd probably get a place for half of that.\n\n             Nettie is doing all right. She washed all my shirts and underwear and washes my socks every day.\n\n            I'm glad you had a nice time at Lucy's tea, wish I could have been present. The Shoups are having Ted Alford and Ed Villmore and me out to dinner tonight. Stuart McDonald wants to have one tomorrow but I told him I am going to New York and I didn't tell him I'd called it off.,[letterhead]                                                                         Harry S.

I'd like just once to eat a sandwich and go to bed with a clear head. I wish we could get enough ahead to go into business in some quiet county-seat town and get out of the whirl but I know that will never happen. Did you see what Cutting did for LaFolletts? I guess they need it as badly as any Senator except one I know.\n\n               I thought the show would be over by July 10th but it looks as if it will never get done now. They've started hearings on the tax bill. The new Senators all had dinner,together last night and Guffey tried to get them to endorse a change in the Senate rules to head off filibusters but seven of us voted him down. He has a desire to be a Senate boss and since I don't like Pennsylvania anyway it wasn't hard for me to be against him. He tried to get Tom P. to bring pressure on me about his real bill and Tom told me about it. I think I'll vote against it although I was rather sold on it before that.\n\n             I had lunch with Harry Hawes, Govner Robinson, Bird, Byrnes, Backman, Clark and Guffey in the V.P.'s private dining room yesterday to eat a sixteen pound fish Hawes caught in Maine. Clark gave the lunch and Robinson and Backman spent the whole hour kidding Bird about voting with Long on Bankheads farm bill. Robinson is a real kidder.\n\n           Kiss my baby and keep writing.

I didn't have to take any lease on the apartment. We rented it until June or until school is out. I suppose we'll have to pay the June because I haven't had time to go.\n\nI'm glad Margaret had a good time at the Bundschu party. I went out to Vic's to dinner last night - had roast duck.

I shall probably leave here at 6:30 on Friday if everything goes as it should. We are invited to a cocktail party at Duke Shoup's on Sunday. Do you have to send cards to that or do you just call up?\n\nI wish you all were here so I wouldn't have to make that trip. Now that's a selfish remark. I wish you were here so I could have you around. Mamma will like the glassware or anything you get. Kiss Margey.

I didn't get down as early as usual this morning. It was 7:15 and Messall came at eight so I didn't get to write as usual. It is now 10:30 and I have dictated at least fifty letters. Yours came on the second mail. I hope you had a nice time at the bridge breakfast and won the prize. I am sorry about Emma Griggs. I'd like to give her a job but there's nothing she can do. All those women have to run a typewriter or do clerical,work. I don't believe she could stand it. If I can get home for a day or two I could straighten the whole business out. I'll go look at the Jefferson and if I can get an apartment I'll surely bring you back. If they get into an argument on the banking bill I'll come home on a bus and drive you and Margey back. How would that do? You be sure and get the car in good shape so it'll make the trip. Knox Alexander was in to see me with his wife this AM. I don't think he's seriously sick. He doesn't like his location and he wanted a vacation. They sent him from Cuba to Edmondton [sic],[letterhead]                                                                                    Harry S.

So you see it doesn't pay to answer your mail. You just get more. Don't for goodness sake say anything about my considering a home coming. If I come I want to do it unannounced. Love to you both.

You know how probabilities work. Glad you like the flowers but I am sorry it wasn't something better. It is good to hear Natalie is better. I hope to leave here Wednesday if everything holds together. Yesterday I intended to go to Quantico to see Major Perkins who has asked me time and again to come down there while he is in command. He was formerly in Kansas City as re-,cruiting officer; but I went to sleep and slept all afternoon. I slept Saturday afternoon and night and Sunday afternoon and night and I'm still sleepy. Maybe I have caught up now. I hope so.\n\nI'll go to N.Y. this P.M. and stop at the Gov Clinton tonight and get my eyes fixed up and if I can get out of having dinner with the doctor will be back here Tuesday afternoon. If I have to go to the dinner I'll get in Wednesday morning and load up and leave.

I couldn't have dinner because there is a coat of ice. It took me more than two hours to come down this morning. Mr. Kemper sent me a ticket to the White House reception for the wives of the National Committee. It would be nice if you would call him and tell him how much you appreciate it. He's been exceptionally nice to me here of late as you know making me his proxy at the meeting. I am enclosing you the letter he,sent which is very nice and also the card. If you'll call him I won't write him. I am sending you four franks and some tags. You should put two franks on each package in case one gets torn off. If you have to use the tags you can if not save them for future use. Here is your check. I made it for $300.00. Your ticket will be $72.00 and some cents and you'll have 25.00 to eat on. Don't wait any longer than you have to. I am all at sea on invitations and everything. The flat seems rather ghostly with just me there. Kiss Miss Margey.

Riley Simrall took me out to Maryland Club Gardens for dinner and I came back to read the ship subsidy bill. You kept looking at me from the picture on the desk and so I spent four dollars, ostensibly to find out about Natalie. Well we always want to convince ourselves that excellent reasons prevail for the things we do. It is an excellent and fundamental reason I guess when a man, senator or hat carrier,gets lonesome for his sweetheart.\n\n               This day has not started off right - no letter. Rush Holt is threatening to pull a Huey Long and talk the tax bill to death. Somebody will probably take a poke at him if he does.

There's a new Hoover vacuum cleaner and other things seem to be all right. Nettie got dinner for me last night and I ate alone in state. There are five big closets and plenty of bedclothes apparently and lots of towels and things. Their dishes aren't anything to brag about,but I think everything is better than last winter. Please look in my right-hand drawer at the top of the chiffonier and put that little shaving brush in your bag. Put in a Gem razor too. It is in a white case. I'll leave it at the office. Also put in that last artillery journal and Annals. There's a little black book about utilities in Missouri I'd like to have too. I think they are all together. Someone has stolen all the tools out of your car and I have to get another set. I can't tell whether it was done at home or on the road. It's a good thing I had no punctures. Here are a couple of wedding announcements and invitation to Mrs. Garner's dinner. I thought you'd better answer it. Guffeys are having an at-home Sunday. That, I guess, takes cards same as Mrs. Brazilian Ambassador did. Please hurry and get here but don't take Margey out too soon. I'll send check and franks tomorrow. Kiss Margey.

You had not written me at all although I called you Monday when I got here and have written you every day. No wonder I had a headache yesterday. Maybe you were too busy with Miss Margey or maybe you didn't have time or something. I do wish you'd let me hear at least every other day. I ought to call you and talk about seven or ten minutes and reverse the charges.\n\nI wish you were both here. I am getting cranky and need,someone to put me back in a good mood. I accepted the Craig dinner. It had to be a written one. I sent it on one of these sheets, which I guess was out of line. Did the same thing for the Forbes Morgan dinner to the national committee. Hope I haven't made a real social error. You'd better get here and look after these things or I'll have us out in the back yard socially. I'll do my best however. I saw Guffey yesterday and he insisted that I come personally to his reception, and I guess I'll have to go. There are only two names on the card but I saw in the paper where Joe and Mrs. Robinson and two or three others were helping him. I guess, I'll make out some way. I don't even know,[letterhead]                                                            \nHarry S. Truman\n Independence, Mo.

Nettie comes every morning and cleans up and fixes everything for breakfast. She's gotten dinner for me twice, but I'm going to the Hickman's tonight and Oscar's tomorrow and suspect I am going to have to go to the Shields' one day. If people would only let me alone, I could get along. It's like Lucy and Mize-they really do embarrass the mischief out of me. I don't do things for people for a reward if I did I ought to be rich.,I do it because I like to do it, but if they just keep harping on it I get sick of it. I'd almost rather they'd pull a Judge Barr stunt than to be forever thanking me or feeding me. Tell Old Nick he'd better send me some sausage. He told me he thought he'd kill hogs after I left so my wife and child would be sure and get it. Glad Fred got the case. I'll keep track of Nettie's bills.\n\n Hope you will write regularly from now on.\n\nLove to you both \nHarry,[circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C. 19 JAN 4 1-PM 1936\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

Said he was sure I wanted it right away. I went out to Oscar's for dinner yesterday and took them back over and showed them the apartment. They thought you might like it. Went on over to Guffey's at five-thirty and had a grand time. Joe Robinson's wife, Mrs. Clark, and one or two others were helping Guffey's three sisters. I found one kindred soul in Minton. His wife hadn't come and he didn't know what to do with himself. He forgot his cards and he,was just having a h-of a time. He said never, never would he come to town again without Mrs. Minton. He and I and old Senator Coolidge and Barkley were the only ones not dressed, as Jimmy Byrnes said, like nigga preachers. Byrnes said here I am at Bennett's suggestion all dressed up like a nigga preacher, and then Bennett wears spats and I don't have any. It was a nice party except that Barkley got sick and they had to send for a doctor and no one knew where to find one. I don't think it was serious. It wasn't what you think, because he hadn't had one. I saw old Doc Copeland give him a pill and that might have done it. I don't know about giving Ann that card because it says not transferable and I'd hate to have the child get the door shut in her face. I'll send you the papers for Tuesday or Wednesday. Hope everybody is well and that I'll see you Saturday. If you leave Thursday, I will.

I honestly believe that house is infected with cold germs or something.\n\nI'm afraid now that there will be another round and you'll never get here. If you ever arrive I'll never let you out of my reach again. You won't get any letters Friday or Saturday and maybe,this one won't arrive so you'll get it.\n\nI went to the Committee meeting yesterday, had lunch with the President and dinner with Forbes Morgan. He has a house out on Mass Ave. next to the Jap Embassy. It has rooms as big as a town hall. We didn't get enough to eat because half his guests just came without saying they would. I was supposed to go to the Supreme Court reception at the White House but I didn't. Bennett and Mrs. Clark and I went to Harveys and got us a sandwich instead. Then I took them home and went to bed. Got my picture in the Washington Post along with Farley and Garner. They took a lot of them at the meeting.\n\nYour badly disappointed dad and sweetheart                   Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C.

I think I told you that it was crystal and not glass. Of course a cheap one couldn't break. Nettie says she thinks the wind blew it off the little table by Margaret's bed. They were using it for a reading lamp. The one on the head of the bed was out. My opinion is that they or Nettie knocked it over. But I'm $19.00 ahead anyway. We got the table down here yesterday; so,now everything is here but the radio. Shall I leave it here as your mother told me to? Hope you found some clothes you liked, and that it's not too hot.\n\n                 We are having the usual hectic fillibuster--stayed up and listened to speech after speech until 1:30 this morning. Neely made a dandy and so did Hastings. I guess we'll do it all over again tonight and maybe get adjourned. Will go to Philly tomorrow if we do. Had a letter from Myra. She had a letter from Hickman and may get her permanent rating. Hope she does. Also had a letter from Mrs. Griggs. She got all straightened out.

It was sticking in a little book on the campaign I'd been carrying around and had almost thrown away a time or two. You'll have ball passes enough to last you for the season I hope. Here is a bill from Margie's school. Shall I pay it? I thought you might want a cook book too.\n\nIt is surely lonesome at that apartment without you. Elsie called me and said she was out,when I called and was not in bed. They are coming after the picture and lamp tonight. The Senate did nothing today. I had lunch with McAdoo. He's been treated shamefully by the President. He said people had been appointed in California who were his (Mc's) bitterest enemies. We had a very pleasant lunch discussing our troubles. He's a smart old bird and I think would still like to run for President.\n\nI'll get my bonus bonds tonight and will lock them up.

That mean you'll be here Saturday A.M. at twenty minutes to eight eastern standard time. Be sure and set your watch up an hour at Cincinnati the night before so you won't have to get up at six instead of seven. You can't help the cost of the railroad tickets and the only time people have been able to get here in cars was the day I got here. Rube Wood had to leave his car at Wheeling and it has been snowing nearly,every day in the mountains. Yes I wrote Mrs. Moss and I'm glad you did. I told her I couldn't taste the cake until you got here. Hope the boxes get here all right with everything. I'm sure they will. If anything should happen you don't leave on Thursday be sure and wire me what time you expect to arrive so I can be on hand to meet you. I went to the Legion dinner for the commander last night. We had a nice time and I got home at ten thirty. I'm going to see Farley this afternoon at 5 P.M. and I hope everything comes out all right. I guess it will.\n\n            I can hardly wait for you to get here. Love to both of you. This will be my last letter unless I get a wire.

If I'd stayed in Philly, it would have cost me five for a hotel and I'd gotten wet besides. The New York Times said this morning that everyone got soaked but they stayed anyway, a hundred and five thousand of them, to hear and see the President and Cactus Jack. That's a real tribute. His speech was a masterpiece I think. The convention was like all such gatherings, just one grand yell from start to finish, and in order to find out what went on it was necessary to read,the papers or go down to a hotel and listen to the radio. You couldn't tell what was happening by being on the floor. I was there every day and every night except Thursday night. When they nominated Roosevelt I left after an hour. Jim Pendergast got the leg of his pants ripped down the front on a railing during the demonstration. Luckily he had another pair - it was a Ted Marks suit. I went to bed early Friday night, got up at 5:00 A.M. real time, and drove down here. Cleaned up the pressing mail and slept all afternoon, called you up, and then went to bed. I've been cleaning off my desk this morning.

I wish I had a gray-checked suit to celebrate in, but I haven't so put on a white one. There is no special prize for seventeen years of married life that I could discover, so you'll have to make out without any. I'd like to be there to take you out to dinner though. Lots of water has gone under the bridge since then. War heroes are no longer that. They are now looked upon as a sort of nuisance and are considered fools to have,gone. Clark made the statement that if his pa had been President, there'd have been no war at all. Oh well!\n\n                   I think my sweetheart is better looking today than ever, if that is possible, and you know it is not fashionable now to think that of the same one. Please kiss Margie and I hope I get that letter tomorrow.

Usually go to dinner somewhere with someone and then come home and read myself to sleep wake up at six thirty and start all over. Went with the Wrights last night. Had a good meal at Harvey's. They are going to New York today to see a couple of shows and,then go home. Wish I could be in Timbuctoo [sic] or some other good far away place, Independence preferably this week. Every job hunter in Missouri is going to be on that train and they are all going to expect me to intercede with the Gov. for them. I won't do it. Here's Miss Margaret's check although I didn't get the letter. If she were not sick I'd dock her in full every week but I'm as usual soft hearted and can never hold anybody's feet to the fire especially my only sweet child. Hope you got off to the city all right and had no slips and slides. Miss Bishop is at the Henderson's most of the time so it will be all right to send the present there.

I seem to be the only source of news in town at present. I think I'll probably come home the middle of Armistice week and stay until Sunday and then fly back. I don't seem to be able to get my thoughts together for some reason. There doesn't seem to be anything to write about. I really believe we can get into 2929.

But I meant it anyway.\n\n          John Snyder is sitting across the desk from me and Vardaman will be down from the R.F.C. in a little while and we'll go over to the gold plated room for lunch. We are going up to Gettysburg tomorrow and fight the battle over once more.\n\n          I'm glad you and Helen had a,pleasant trip to town. You should do it oftener. I'm glad you had the bed fixed but that won't keep you from getting a new one if you want it. I've been hesitating on the investment and it was well I did because everything went down after the Court message. I'm for it however. I'm studying the situation and will try to make a safe bet so we'll all come out ahead.\n\n     Hope you are all well and happy.

When we arrived back in Washington about five o'clock I refused to have dinner with either or both Jake and him, comming on down to the office and looking over the mail, then getting stamps, envelopes and stationary and comming over to the hotel with a certainty in my mind that a special would be in the box. Well it wasn't! I guess there must have been a slip-up somewhere and I'll probably get two tomorrow.\n\nJohn and Jake agree with me that Marse Robert had insurmountable difficulties at Gettysburg and that the Almighty was on the side of Meade,,just as he was at Waterloo with Wellington. We read Freeman's description, studied the maps, and by every rule of military maneuver, Lee should have won. Vardaman didn't go with us but we let him in on the discussion. It looks as if John would get Jake's job. He's going to work for a St. Louis bank at some $25,000 per year. So I'll have to tell Mr. Roosevelt he doesn't want on the Federal Reserve Board. I feel like kicking him but I don't blame him. Snyder advises me to study law and finance and get myself a job like it. Maybe I can but I doubt it. I'm too much enamored of the Sermon on the Mount to be a good banker.\n\nKiss Margie. I hope I get two tomorrow.

I didn't have any opportunity to take Mrs. Damaree and Mrs. Swofford to lunch - anyway you'll have to pay my feminine social obligations.

Vardaman's call, a wire from Cincinnati, and a phone call on Sunday night. The facts are that I can't find anything and I can't get to my desk. All day yesterday the telephone men were working on it and this morning another phone man is doing it all over. I'm sitting at Bud's desk now waiting for a chance to get to mine. But I sure will have a grand office when I get through. There are two rooms as big as my old private office, both with fireplaces, and two other,rooms the size of the girls' room in the old office. There is also a storeroom for books and stationery. The building manager has been exceptionally nice to me. I wish you and Margie were here to help me enjoy it.\n\n           The Senate Democrats had a caucus yesterday and put Joe Robinson in charge again. I went to Phila. yesterday afternoon to exchange your Christmas present and they didn't have your size. I find they are imported and it will take three weeks to get two like yours. But they are going to do it and mail them to you.\n\n           The Senate will have its opening meeting today and then down to real business. I'll not miss any more this week and then I'm going to make you a proposition. Kiss Margie and I hope for a letter.

I was going to call and reverse the charges if the letter hadn't come. The Carroll Arms is trying very hard to get me over there but I don't know whether I'll go or not. It's very nice and all new. I'll try to find an apartment about March 1. Maybe things will be in better shape then. I talked to the big man in the Portland Cement, the President. I didn't talk to Kinney but I will. The way they talked to me I thought it was all arranged. I still think it is too. When Kinney comes back here next week I'll find out what they meant. Why would they tell me to have Fred go up there?,I went to dinner with Bill Hicks and Gen Holland I think it was. I've a book by him on Hindenburgs battle of Tannenburg there at home somewhere. He is a tough old black Republican but very nice to talk to. Clark and I got together this A.M. and the Federal Judge is all set. Will be in tomorrow's papers.\n\n          Wheeler and his committee have been going good this morning questioning Mr. Potter of Guarantee Trust Co and Mr. Swan of the same outfit. They were capable witnesses. Wheeler couldn't browbeat either of them.\n\n             Mrs. Burke wanted to know if you were in town. Their daughter is recovering. I should have told you that Sunday.

I have been very busy today going over a tremendous mail and trying to get my judge matter straightened out with Clark. It looks as if we'll get it done tomorrow or next day, probably the day after that. You know how the potential presidential candidate keeps his appointments. One at 10:00 A.M. means about 4:00 P.M. two days afterwards. He's been sober for two whole days though, and we may get it done.\n\n                 Went to dinner for the Legion National Commander last night and saw a dozen or so Senators and as many,Congressmen. Jim Farley was sitting in the lobby at the hotel (the Mayflower) talking to Senator Bailey who as you know is the most pompous and big-headed senator next to old Walsh of Mass. Maybe I lack dignity. I told Mr. Colmery the Commander how pleased I was at Cleveland to help elect him and get him out of Alf Landon's speaking bureau. He seemed somewhat embarrassed because Dick Russell and Sen.

I met the V.P. and her in the elevator at the Washington as I went up to the Naval banquet.,Ryan Duffy, Nate, Bill Bulow, Tydings, Pat Harrison and myself had on every day clothes. Ashurst, Jimmy Burns [sic], Thomas of Utah, Tom Connally, and nearly all the new men had on their nigger preacher coats. Bilbo Burke and someone else I can't remember had on Tuxedos; so that there was variety enough to suit everyone. Clark had on his long coat. I noticed that nearly all who had their wives with them were properly dressed. Mrs. Clark offered to chaperone me until you come. It was a nice party. Nate only wanted to stay a half hour. We arrived at 5:30 and I left at 7:30 and he was still talking to Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Clark and the Misses Guffey. He called me up after I got back to the hotel and very profusely apologized. I went up to see him and we parted good friends.\n\n         The Henderson dinner was a family affair and most pleasant. I gave the twins my pass to Lowes for this week and pleased 'em to death.

I was under the impression that if I found a bargain in a place to stay, you would still come. Was talking to Nate Bachman today and he said Mrs. B called him and told him she had bought a burro and he asked her what she did that for when she had plenty of horses, and she told him that her inclination was to buy a jackass because he'd been away so much. He found out that she was getting it for her grandbaby. Maybe I'm in the jackass class.\n\nWent to a dinner last night where O'Mahoney, Black, Thomas of Utah, Minton and Adams discussed the Constitution. It was most interesting. Tonight I am having dinner with Oscar tomorrow night with Naval Reserve tomorrow noon with,Sam Rayburn and Sunday night at Senator Guffey's. He's going to set the new Democrats in the way they should go.\n\nI am enclosing you some more invitations, and I'm still wishing you were here. I introduced my driver's bill today.

I found out from Littlejohn that she is the Walgreen Drug Co. so I guess she can afford mince pies.\n\n                It was a beautiful day and I enjoyed it. It would have been nicer if you and Margey had been there. The Littlejohns are lovely people and have,a daughter just Marg's age.\n\n           I had all the boys there I am acquainted with come and see me after the game and they are a fine looking outfit. It seemed to please them very much.\n\n           I'm to see T.J. this afternoon and then back to the grind tomorrow again.\n\n              Kiss Margey.

Maybe it will come in the next mail. I have been looking at ads again and there is an apartment in Tilden for rent and one at 2110 19th St. which is right across from the school. I'm going to have Vic look at it today if he can get away. They are both furnished however. I thought maybe we could get into one or the other of them and then by taking the furnished one on a month to month basis we could get the unfurnished one fixed up. What do you think of that sort of an arrangement?,I have balled things up again. They are having a celebration in Washington Twp. to open up their water system. The date was set for Nov. 6 and I told them I wouldn't be home on the 6th but would on the 13th. So - they promptly changed the date. My football game has gone a glimmering. Why don't you and Margey go on with the two Taylors and enjoy it anyway?\n\nHere is an invitation from the Gordons. I don't know whether it has to be answered or not so I'm sending it to you. Elsie went to the hospital yesterday morning and just had a baby boy. The nurse just told me both doing fine. Vic says Mrs. G. looks as if it might be triplets. Mrs. V. said she'd let you know how that one comes out.\n\nKiss Margey. Love to you.

He's all broken up over the unexpected death of the girl he was getting ready to marry. Said she had a clot in her heart and couldn't come out of it. I'll have to write him today and I wish I didn't. You remember him. He was in the office with Myra.\n\n          Too bad John has been so weighted down with his postal duties. I think he's looking for an excuse to quit and I've an idea he'd be better off, but it would sure be hell on the government. I don't know what I want for Christmas. Some socks and ties are always useful. A fellow from Springfield is sending a turkey. So don't buy one unless you want,to bring it back here with you. We've a box of potatoes from Idaho and five pounds of coffee the colonel from West Point sent me-so we can have coffee and potatoes. I don't drink coffee and you won't eat potatoes. We should do fine with that start. I'm glad you had the piano tuned. I'm coming on the train. There's no use having two cars back there when we'll need 'em here.\n\n         Haven't done any more on furniture because my committee has been going all day every day. But will look some more after Wednesday--tomorrow Mary said she is having mamma's birthday dinner Sunday after Christmas. Said she had talked with you about it.\n\n         The weather man failed again--still no snow but it's cold enough and cloudy. I may break into print again this week.

Rather glad you did not go to Bill Duke's tea if you felt you could get away without driving into a post. Hope you don't get a cold. I haven't had a headache until yesterday, and that wasn't caused by any overwork here but because I'd mixed things up so for the thirteenth. I certainly need a guardian. I had a letter from Vivian about the opening of the water plant in Washington Township. I had promised him I'd come and talk about county planning, etc., so as to give the section a boost. He's worked so hard on it and it may mean that we could get a buyer for that 200 acres and save the farm, which as you know is my greatest worry because of Mamma.,She knows nothing of the extremity to which the mortgage holders have been pressing us for payment. In fact when Vivian and I went to see them last when I was at home they told us point-blank if something wasn't done by December 1 they'd take over. Well I'm afraid it would kill her and I want to keep her alive as long as I can.\n          \nI want to go to Columbia because we always have a good time and we've had so little chance to have one together here of late. You see why I had a headache?\n\n Had another wire from Leighton Shields. He's in a peck of trouble--the State Department refuses to support his family in Manila and he's really up against it. I guess I'll have to go and see Mr. Hull or F.D.R.\n\nI've certainly been raising hell in that committee. They had rumors in New York papers that Wheeler was not behind me. I wired him and told me he is for me and to let 'em have it, and I have. It's rather a wearing job though.

This so-called committee work is nothing but drudgery and publicity, all so depressing sometimes. I'm not so sure that even after I've aired all the Missouri Pacific dirty linen that anything but another chance to dirty some more will come of it. You can't change human greed for money in a committee. The money hogs control the counting, and there's no use trying to keep 'em from it. All we can do is to make the yoke as easy as possible.\n\nIt was nice to talk to you last night, only I wish I'd been there instead of a thousand miles away.,Your and Margaret's special came promptly this morning just as I was leaving the hotel for a walk. I'll send Catherine downtown for the hair nets. I wish you and Margey were here. This is going to be a dreary day even if the sun does shine. Perry wants to take me for a ride this afternoon but I'm not sure I'll go.\n\nVic & Perry & Mrs. Vic took me to the foot ball game Friday night between Miss. V. & Geo Washington. Miss. won by 26 to 7. It rained nearly all the time the game was on but they managed to play it anyway.

We also looked at the Westchester and 2929 Connecticut. 2929 is the best place and the manager is going to call me as soon as they have 2 bedrooms vacant. They want 105.00 and 110.00 just the same as Mrs. Nally and Sedgwick. No vacancies at Sedgwick. Saw a house on 34th St., a very nice place.

Three lawyers for the committee were here and the situation seems to get worse and worse.

If I don't I can't get home until Saturday night at 8:30 which will ruin all the meetings.\n\nWould you and Margey consider comming [sic] back with me? I get so lonesome I don't know what to do with myself and all I can do is come over here and work. Vic and Mrs. Vic took me to the,Allies Inn last night for dinner. It is the only place Vic can get any vegetables properly fixed away from home. He can't eat anything but mashed potatoes, mashed peas and beans and cottage cheese. Most of his food has to be run through a collinder [sic]. He's gaining weight on it however and I think will be cured up if he stays with it.\n\nThe coal commission had a reception from 5 to 7 last night too. Vic and I went to that and then went to dinner and I came back here and met the lawyers. I'm in for really raising hell this week. I'm afraid all the N.Y. bankers and some in St. Louis and Kansas City will be off me for life. I've got to go through now though or be a quitter.

They have an apartment over a store on Connecticut at S Street. You remember where the Packard place is at the corner of S and Conn. Ave? They are directly across the street. It is a very nice apartment with a large living room overlooking the Ave with French windows all the way across the front. The kitchen and hallway are parallel behind the living room and the bath and bed room are at the rear of the hallway. They just have the springs for a bed but no bed.

The dinner was good and I got back to,the hotel at eleven o'clock.\n\n          Mrs. Griggs arrived at one o'clock last night and was in to see me this morning. She is looking fine but has a sprained tendon in her right ankle but said she'd be all right today. She and John seem to be having a fine time. Had a letter from Roger Sermon saying he'd be here Tuesday. Emory Wright and Matt are having dinner with me tonight. It is just too bad you aren't here. What a time you'd have! You should be glad you are A.W.O.L. this week. I'm going to be a worn out dishrag by next Saturday but I guess I can take it. I didn't make up my mind to go to Baltimore the other night until ten minutes before I did it so I couldn't tell Mr. Faris or Mr. Messall. My middle hasn't pained since so I guess it's all right.\n\n         Kiss Margie and Love to you Harry.,[printed]                                          [circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C. 13 JAN 16 4-PM 1937\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\nHarry S.

Mr. Sawyer seems to have made the headlines anyway. He and Salisbury worship money, so if the lady extracts any of it from him it will make a bad wound. I also appreciated the picture. Mr. Alford finally discovered I am in town after the Associated Press had taken care of the hearings. He called me yesterday. Mr. Shoop has been in Topeka helping Mr. Landon on his radio speech. I suppose Roy Roberts wrote it. It turned out to be a flop and a disappointment. Even the,Washington Post and Star could see no good in it.\n\n         Wish I could have been with you at Platte. I ought to come home next Saturday and meet with the Senate Committee on Agriculture but I just don't see how I can make it. This committee has witnesses coming nearly every day, and besides it costs too much and no one ever pays my expenses. The Masonic Lodge in St. Louis sent me $20.25 so that's one that did. The Gov. has asked the Committee and Clark and me to lunch that day. Please send me last weeks Mo Democrat ours didn't come. I have a nice room at the Carroll Arms but it's a dreary place without you and Margey.

The sun shines out of the bluest sky I've seen this year, and the Va mountains are painted every color of the rainbow by frost. Just passed the Farmington Country Club and it certainly looked good. We've been going through some high mountains and a lot of tunnels. The cedars and pines make the oaks and elms stand out. The mountainsides look like patch work quilts with dark green for the main color.\n\nThis is rather a slow motion train. Left St. Louis at noon stopped at Indianapolis fifty minutes and stayed forty five at Cincinnati. It will arrive in Washington at 12:45,if it is on time and it seems to be. It is a very fine train called \"The Sportsman.\" They have one they name Geo. Washington to.

I have had a rather hectic time since Wednesday when my R.R. hearings started. Every reporter in Washington except the Star reporters has been after me. I had to write two speeches also. I don't like alibis and never credit them. When anything is to be done nothing should prevent it and you can merely take the above statement as one of fact and no excuse.,I should have written just the same. My St. Louis trip was a success. I met and talked to the Young Dems and they seemed very happy to see me. Canfil took me to Cape Girardeau and I saw all my south Mo. friends. That is Fred took his car and brought me back to St. Louis. I road [sic] down with Clark, John Nangle and the Mayor in the Mayors car. Learned a lot about Mo. politics, Mr. Stark and the senarotial situation. We still have things in hand. Though they all have ambitions to control.\n\nHad a grand breakfast at Jake Vardaman's and John Snyder put me on the train. I am trying a new train. Will arrive at noon tomorrow and wire you.

We'll see just what they have in mind. Had dinner with Paul Nachtman and Mr. Pratt of the labor relations board last night and found out all the low down on the Ford, Montgomery Ward and Nell Donnelly situations. There is a lot more behind the scenes in all those troubles than publicly appears. I believe though that it will work out all right in the end. Our City Manager has had a finger,in most of those things and sometimes a sledge hammer.\n\nI told you last night that some of us are going deer hunting Dec 1 with Guffey. We leave here Nov 30th and go up to a resort in the Penn. mountains. Guffey said we would not do much walking, that we'd sit in a valley and the deer would be driven out for our bullets. I am not going to shoot any because it's too much like killing a person. I'll go along though and perhaps have other entertainment besides shooting.\n\nHope your hand is well or better.

You know more about how these things ought to be done than I'll ever learn. I'm glad that Margaret enjoyed her dancing school. I guess the reason boys are so scarce is that boys haven't changed much. A team of horses couldn't have gotten me pulled into one when I was the age of those boys, and I was considered rather below par by most,of my associates at that.\n\nEddie Jacobson came in yesterday and I took him to lunch. We organized a tenth-of-a-cent poker game last night and rolled him of fifty cents and Vic of fifty-four cents. If it hadn't been 10 percent settlement you can see where that decimal point would have been.

We ate at the Hay-Adams. They have a very swanky dining room - pipe organ music etc. I'm to have lunch with Scott Faris and Perry today or tomorrow and Mr. Helm on the other day. The Washington papers all noted my arrival in town and the why of it - but our own failed to make a note of it.,I guess they are still worrying over Mr. Milligan. Catherine and I almost cleaned off my desk. It was a mile high. I'll get most of my reading done today and my Cape speech written and then I can study railroads tomorrow. I am going to try and see Mrs. Nally tomorrow and also Weaver Bros about Sedgwick. It is a most unsatisfactory way to live but nearly everyone has some sort of difficulty and all life is is beating the difficulties and making things as pleasant as possible.

For some reason which I can't explain I slept until nine-fifteen, although I went to bed at ten. Maybe it was because I was out in the air most of yesterday.\n\nWe were supposed to leave here at nine o'clock but for some reason - really a headache from the night before I think - Al Holland didn't show up until ten-thirty. We got to the Glenn Martin plant at noon and the picture men were just on the point of leaving because they were afraid we weren't coming. I went through the factory with,the general manager and saw a lot of planes under construction for the Dutch East India Company and the government of the Argentine.\n\nThe one we went to see was out in the back yard. Its wing spread is 157 ft., body 91 ft. long, and it's 20 ft. high, has four 1,000-hp motors, and will go 225 mi. per hour. It can go 5,000 miles on one fill-up and will carry twenty-six people and several thousand pounds of freight and mail. Russia owns it, and it cost them $750,000. It weighs 63,000 pounds. We had a grand time, ended up with lunch at the Belvedere in Baltimore. Got back here at six and called you at seven. Glad I didn't miss you. Here's Mrs. Black's letter.

I am wishing you were here already and if I find an apartment you are coming. It is very fine weather here. The sun shines and the breeze is in the south. I stayed at the Hay-Adams last night in a room as big as my office with a bathtub that Taft could have used. They are very anxious to rent it to me by the month. I looked at some rooms at the Raleigh and they were very nice too. The Carroll-Arms has raised the price and are very,independent so I'll probably end up by going to the Continental unless the Raleigh or the Hay-Adams make me a very good price.\n\n      Ran into Minton as I came out of the Raleigh and he brought me down to the Capitol. His wife is just coming out of the hospital from an operation. They took her gall bladder out. He said they had just returned from Europe. He was sick all the way over and they took her off the boat to the hospital when they got back. He says \"to hell with Europe.\"\n\n      Vic is looking fine but is on a vegetable diet. His food has to go through a collender [sic] like a baby's. Perry says hello.\n\n       The President sent me his latest picture all endorsed and everything. Wasn't that nice? Tell everyone hello. Kiss M.\n\n       Love to you Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 2 OCT 17 4-PM 1937\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n                                                                                                                       \nMrs. Harry S.

Hope you don't get any colds. Maybe it will keep you from it. I suppose Margaret is having the time of her life in the play. Wish I could slip in and see it. I've done nothing more on apartments. Both were rented when I got back. Maybe 2929 will have a vacancy. Let's hope so.\n\nThe St. Louis Star Times had three pictures in a row showing your old man presiding over a hearing. I didn't know they took 'em - and the Post Dispatch had another good editorial. I'm not sure I'm doing right after that.\n\nHad a fine dinner with Mr. and Mrs. Henderson and the twins. The boys were all some,where else. The Col. and I had a fine visit and settled all the ills of the country. I came back to the office and studied the farm and reorganization bill and went to bed at ten o'clock.\n\n I missed a call from Shannon by being away from the hotel. He's going home Wednesday. Jim P. said he hoped I'd keep him here but I'm glad he's going home. He says Stark will run against Clark and not against me. Well we'll see. Farley told me they were not going to help the Gov against us on any count. I hope he was speaking for the White House, but you never can tell. I'm to see F.D.R. when he gets back from Warm Springs.\n\nTake good care of yourself. Don't take cold.

No extractions necessary; heart all right; and so is everything else. Will hear from the complete blood test tomorrow. Dieting is overboard. That was principally the difficulty,- starvation. The rest has been just what was needed. The staff here know their business and they have no reason for fooling me. I've about made up my mind to do it once a year.

I told Mildred she'd better get one for me if she valued her job. Fred Canfil called me this morning and talked for ten minutes. It's a good thing the county pays the bill. He's coming to Washington on Saturday and will go to the football game with me at Philadelphia. I had four tickets this year because I'm on Military Appropriations. Had to pay 45 cents tax on each one. Could have sold them for $25.00 each. Maybe I'd have been saner to sell 'em. I gave Vic two and kept the others. It would be a perfect day if you and Margey were with me at the kickoff.\n\nWell the filibuster is over. We took,up the farm bill today and spent all afternoon listening to the reading clerk. There are 97 pages and it took him two hours to read it.\n\nI presided yesterday for about 15 minutes and got into the N.Y. Times. Connelly started a row and I squelched him. The Senate upheld me. Afterwards I sat by him and he wanted to know what chance a Texan had when two Missourians were on him. The fracas was between him and Clark. You'll find it after the second quorum call in yesterdays record.\n\n I've ended the Clark-Stark hook up. It is rumored that Farley and the Pres are at outs which won't help me any.

I have not had a before-breakfast walk since I came here last Monday. They are always doing something to me by seven o'clock, so I don't get a chance. I have to go to the lab for another and more elaborate blood test this morning. I saw all the doctors yesterday and told them I'd have to leave Thursday morning and it was O.K. I am not yet on a diet and it looks as if I won't be. There are only two,more tests and then I'll be reported sound in mind and limb and salable on any block.\n\nWe took a drive yesterday and didn't get a chance to write you. They organized a penny-ante game on the fourth floor and asked for amateurs. I reported and by nine o'clock, quitting time, I had not only learned how to play but had $1.25 of their funds. Funny how easy it is to learn some things and how hard others. For instance, I've been trying to memorize the preamble to the Constitution and can't. Kiss Margie. Sorry she didn't get to Colorado.

I waited until nine-fifteen this evening hoping I'd still get one and I thought once I'd go on to bed and not write. I was so lonesome I took a fool notion to go to a picture show - the first one I've been to since we went to the Midland and sat up in the heaven. It was Leslie Howard and Bette Davis in It's Love I'm After and it is a scream. Well after I'd laughed my blue spell off I just came back to the office and here's your letter.\n\n\\We've been on the Farm Bill all day - Pope taking up all the time,explaining its constitutionality, etc. I presided part of the time and no rows took place. Burke, Minton, Halsey, and several more are all going to the football game Saturday. We're going on the train. Canfil called and said he'd come and go with me. Ten to one he doesn't show up. I gave Vic two of my tickets. I get four now being on the Military Appropriations. Vic asked me out to eat turkey tomorrow - so did Elsie but I'd already promised Vic. She said the boy is doing very well and growing to beat the band. Mrs. Gardelli is still in the anticipation stage.\n\n\\Found a tailor today who agreed to press my clothes correctly so I guess I can begin to look decent again soon. I took him three suits today. He's an old Dane down here on Pennsylvania Avenue and I believe he'll do a good job. Hope I get two letters tomorrow.

He'll see you when he gets back. I was glad to get the Lodge letter and J.K.V.'s too. Of course J.K. can't make his arrangements until he knows what mine are and of course he doesn't know. Does the St. Louis Mayor want us Sunday or Monday? I thought it was Monday. Canfil wasn't sure. You make him read you the Mayors letter and then I'll wire that St. Louis Lodge.\n\nThey photographed my teeth today and finished my eye examination. This eye man is as good as I've had. The glasses needed a change. The heart photo was analyzed and found it all right. One valve is smaller than it should be but it isn't the one that gives trouble so they say. The blood test isn't finished but I've had enough to eat four days hand running anyway. Fred can tell you how grand I'm fixed up. There are four doctors giving me special care and I'm nearly rested.

It was a very great pleasure to talk to you last night, however, and I hope you do it again tomorrow. Today was my busy day. I got up at six-thirty, had breakfast at seven-thirty, a blood test at eight, throat and nose at nine; eyes at nine-thirty, and a real Hot Springs bath at ten. They really do it scientifically here. Then I had a tooth exam at eleven-thirty. They are going to X-ray tomorrow and give me another eye test. There is a very fine eye man here and he seems to be very much interested in getting me properly fixed. My astigmatic axis has changed again,and he says that may cause the headaches.\n\nThey are really feeding me. I was half starved too I reckon, but I'm eating all they give me now and it's plenty. It surely is a place to rest, and they treat me like a king.\n\nHad another picture show tonight-Lily Pons in The Girl from Paris. It was good too. Then Congressman Crosser and three army colonels and myself talked until ten o'clock settling all the country's ills. I'm writing this in bed. Kiss Margie.\n\nLove to you-call me\nHarry\n\nHope I'm not entirely lost down here.

That is what I intended to look at but didn't. It was too late when Vic's dinner was over. I rather think we'll not have a lot of trouble getting one when we really want it.\n\n                 The Clark dinner (lunch she called it) was quite an affair. Jimmy Burnes [Byrnes] and his wife were there as were Joe Tumulty, Mrs. Adams, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley Reed, the Mayor and Mrs. Allen and Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Maestre (a couple I don't like.) They had cocktails, a sufficient number, and then a turkey dinner caffeteria [sic] style. Maybe \"buffet\" would,be a better word? Ed Villamore carved the turkey. There was a fresh baked ham from Saline County too. Jack Dempsey and his wife were there. The Congressman from N. Mex. not the fighter. So was Col Jack Williams. It was a very nice affair. Jimmy told us about his trip to Germany and the Mayor explained how St. Louis avoided strikes. He didn't mention Ford. Mrs. Clark seemed really glad to see me and said she wished you were there. I gave her your message.\n\n            One pen goes dry and the other leaks. Canfil and I went to see Jeanette on the passes - the first time I've used them. It is a beautiful show and I thought of Emma Trentini and wished as I always do you were here.

No letter this morning, but I received one from Mamma in her own handwriting thanking me for her birthday letter and telling me how nice the stockings were Margaret gave her. I rented an apartment today from Mrs. Nally. We take it January 1 at $110 per month. It has a nice living room twenty-three feet long, a dining room about ten by twelve, two bedrooms, one bath, and five or six closets. You'll have to pick out your furniture after you arrive. It is a very nice place on the fourth floor. The people who took it September 15 had to leave town. It is,as new and clean as if it had never been lived in before. We'll have to get a rug for the living room and maybe for one bedroom, then whatever you think you need to sit on in the living room, the balance of the dining-room furniture, twin beds for one room and a single for the other. I guess we can stay at the hotel while you're buying furniture.\n\n            Fred Canfil went home last night. He took me to O'Donnell's Sunday night after we went to the show and ordered a dozen fried oysters. I ordered a half-dozen and when he wasn't looking I put three of mine in his dish. He ate the whole fifteen, a half a head of lettuce, three or four rolls, a bottle of beer, and a cup of coffee. Said it was a pretty fair meal, although he thought he only had a dozen oysters.

Bud and Sharon appreciated the chance to talk to you. I am going out there to dinner tonight & Sunday - making up for lost time. I'm sorry you didn't like my hickory shirt idea for Guffy's party. It was a brand new one and looked pretty keen with my blue suit. I guess though I'll have to wear my nigger preacher coat to the Henderson affair. I may go the whole hog and put on my tall hat too now what do you think of that. I am regreting another reception Sunday by Chas. T. Russell's. It just came so I can't send it to you. I am sending you some calling cards in which you might be in-,interested.\n\nHad a nice party at the Willard last night in Boise Penrose's suite. Bennett called Roy Roberts Sen Penrose all evening. He didn't know he had engaged the Penrose suit but Bennett said it surely was Roy Roberts. Ted Alford, Duke Shoup, Harry Woodring and the two Mo Senators made up the party. I found out a lot of things by keeping still and letting Mr. Roberts talk. Mr. Shannon brought about the investigation in Kansas City and now he's blaming the Star. Oh! Well maybe one will do some good any way. I may move to the Carroll Arms Sunday. They're offered me a brand new room for 17.00 per wk. I'm really getting by for less than $150.00 per month which is something but I still don't like it. I'll send you the Star. It's the best paper and you've had the Post. Hope everyone stays well.

My train was one hour late and arrived at 10:25 instead of nine. Vic met me and I deposited my bags at the hotel and found a special there from you and one at the office when I got there along with at least a hundred more and Vic had answered that many. I dictated as long as I could and then went over to the Senate in time to vote on the bill Vic wired about some three or four times and it isn't passed yet. So I was on time. Mr. Kinney is coming to see me tomorrow and I may have something to tell Fred. Hope so anyway. They'll use him now in Chicago if he can go,there, but I still think I can arrange the other.\n\n         Mrs. Damaree called me and asked me to have dinner with her and Mrs. Swofford at the Allies Inn and I went. Had a very pleasant evening until nine P.M. from 6:30 discussing negro voters, League of Nations etc etc. ad. lib. It's now nine thirty and I'm in the office writing you and getting ready for two hours work. I'm enclosing you some Cong. Club things and Mrs. Barnes letter in which I thought you'd be interested. Fred got his tie. Told me some time ago but I thought he meant one I gave him here and paid no attention to it. You know they are very careless on social obligations.

Evidently the mails have been mixed up. If I'd known you were in bed I'd have been at home Senate or no Senate, Committee or no Committee. Mr. Dominick was not very courteous to me. He had no authority to print any correspondence,of mine without my specific permission, and of course he wouldn't have gotten it. I expect to make my position perfectly plain when the time comes but there is no use going off half ready. The President approached the thing by indirection which he should not have done. It would have been much easier if he'd have just stated the case as it is without age or any other subterfuge. We have precedents a plenty - all set by Republican Presidents and there,are plenty of good reasons for increasing the courts without going around the barn to do it.\n\n             I'm writing this in the foyer of the Senate Chamber with Pat Harrison and Tom Heflin having an argument right behind me and Garner and Barber [sic] down the hall having another.

It started off right by bringing me a good letter. Canfil was on the train and as pleased as a ten year old boy to go to the game. He had a blanket, hunting jacket, muffler, rain coat, overcoat and overshoes. It was a spring day with April showers and fog so the raincoat was all that was needed. Took him around and introduced him to the V.P. who made his usual hit. Sens. Duffy and daughter, Burke and wife, Swellenback [Schwellenbach] and wife and Chavez and wife were on our car along with a lot of Senate employees. Minton was with his Sec as I was. Vic and Perry used my other two tickets. I am on the Military Appropriations Sub-Committee not the Military Affairs Committee but I get the same sort,of recognition. You remember when I ceased being an alderman for D.C. and got Sen. Glass to change me over.\n\n        Connelly was happy over his squelching. He was just using filibustering tactics. Sorry I forgot to put a special on my Tuesday letter. I've given the girls orders to put one on the Friday letters.\n\n         Glad you saw mamma and also that she's looking so well. I missed writing you yesterday - that's no 1. I was so wet and tired when I got back to Washington I just took a hot bath and went to bed. When your special came this A.M. I felt very badly about not sitting up and getting one off.\n\n         The game was a soggy affair. Too wet for the parade and show. The Army out played the Navy though. The Navy's mascot is a goat and the Army's a mule. They have two mules one a regular mule and the other a South American donkey given them by the Peruvian Ambassador whose son is at the Point. They dressed the donkey up like a goat and unloaded him from an ambulance in front of the Navy,[letterhead]                                                                                                           \nHarry S. Truman                        \nIndependence, Mo. [/letterhead]  \n\nstands, mounted an army man in an admirals uniform on him and had a fellow on the mule in army uniform chase him around the arena and shoot him. The \"Admiral\" and the donkey both fell in front of the Naval contingent much to the pleasure of the Army boys. It probably wouldn't have been so funny if they hadn't won afterwards. Canfil yelled himself hoarse. When the Army was about to score and failed he shouted \"More brutality Army - what are you being trained for anyway.\" He entertained the spectators for acres around. Mr. and Mrs. Cochrane sat a couple of rows behind us. They left however at the end of the first quarter on account of the rain.\n\n                I hope you can see one of those games some day but I hope it won't be in,the rain. I want to see one when they have all the trimmings. We'll do it someday.\n\n              I am going out to Clark's for dinner today. The Mayor of St. L. will be there as will his fianc? Mrs. Allen and I don't know who else. I have, successfully I think, convinced Clark that the Gov. is after his scalp as well as mine. He apparently thinks there's something in it. The Gov. and the Pres would like to be heroes and boss busters and Clark has definitely lined up with the Boss you see. He and Maurice Milligan almost came to blows the last time they met and now the Pres and Stark are thinking of running him for Senator against Clark. I'm not sure it won't happen if the Post Dispatch, the Star and the Springfield and St Joe papers can bring it about. My position gets better all the time.\n[underlined] Wish you were here.

It is three o'clock and no letter. We had a night session last night-lasted until eleven o'clock. We may get to a vote before we quit tonight. I hope we do and then we'll sure get recessed before this year ends. We've tentatively agreed to quit December 22 and I'm sure we will.,I've really stirred up a hornet's nest in the Railroad Committee. The president of the New York Bar has been down to see about investigating those rich and snooty lawyers who have been helping the bankers to loot the railroads, and the chairman of the House Committee was over to see me about bringing impeachment proceedings against that old Chicago judge about whom I gave out the mean interview.

[/letterhead] \nPennsylvania Train No. 30 to Washington \n 2/1/1937\n\nDear Bess:-  It was good to hear your voice last night, but not half as good as really seeing and talking to you - even if my combination of words makes you sick some times. I suppose I'm a clown and a fool but I've never cared much how words were combined if their meaning happened to be honest and sincere, and that is all words are for. Maybe you don't know it, but I'd rather lose a hand or have an eye pulled out than make you a moment's suffering or hurt - either mentally or physically. I've seen so much difficulty caused by sheer unthoughtfulness that I've tried all my life to be thoughtful and to make every person I come in contact with happier for having seen me. Maybe that's silly too. I don't know. I've never paid any attention to what people here said about me and very little to what they say to me, because most people only mean about half they say. Well, the sun has,been shining all afternoon, although it snowed all forenoon in St. Louis. The B.&O. canceled their 11:58 train last night and the Pennsylvania 12:30 A.M. train gets to Washington at exactly the same hour as the one that leaves at nine the next morning, so I decided to take the noon train, \"Spirit of St. Louis\" and arrive at 9:25, two hours after the other two. The Gov. was most cordial, but he is going to do as he pleases - and so would I if I were in his shoes. I really believe he'll make one of Missouri's real ones. Anyway he's not a booze fighter nor is he running after the ladies. So if we don't get jobs for the faithful, maybe the State will profit anyway. He likes pomp and circumstance and maybe that's all there is to any of it. The train is rough.

I always set mine at ten. None of these old Senators ever did a day's work before breakfast as I have in times past and they really don't appreciate the early hours. I'd never get things done if I started at ten thirty. As it was we had to quit the St. Paul hearing before we finished. Pennsylvania is the dish today. It is raining today and I think it will be ice when it's done.\nI wish you'd tell me what you want for Christmas. I'm going uptown before the day is over,and get you some hairnets and perfume if I don't hear what you want. Another furniture man is making me an estimate and I am to see about that Friday. We'll get something done I'm sure that will be good and at a right price. They are all very anxious to sell at a cash price and I believe that is the best thing to do. You know I've been saving $800.00 for the purpose right along and a hundred or two more can be spared if it is necessary. We'll not be ashamed of what we have anyway.

I got up at six this morning, put on my yellow shirt and walked up the mountain and back. The sign says it is 1.5 miles up. I made a short cut or two and judge I made it in a mile. Anyway I made the round trip in 35 minutes. No one was up except an old granddad sitting on a bench halfway up the hill and the negro bellboy delivering papers to the rooms. The front door of the hotel was lock when I went out. I didn't know they ever locked 'em. It was a perfectly grand morning - cool and clear. All,these people shivering like winter time. I came back took a bath another nap and had breakfast at 8:30. Wrote my St. Louis speech and sent it to Vic to type and then [underlined] took another nap. [/underlined] It was noon by then so I ate a light lunch and walked to the other end of town looked over the shows but didn't go in.

He was a smart politician in his day, but like all of them lost touch with things as they were.\n\n            The Barnes came this morning and Bud took them to the White House and several other places.

It was over a mountain range and the most beautiful scenery. Goes through Ouachita National Forest. So you see I got to Ouachita even if it is spelled in a peculiar manner.\n\nHave a beautiful room at the Park Hotel for $3.00 a day, tub and shower, a big fan, and everything but a radio, and I can live without that I guess.

Bud brought me a letter to Wheeler's committee and I read it while Mr. Whitney-the Mr. Whitney, president of the New York Stock Exchange-was telling what he thought of taking one thousand shares of Allegheny Corporation at twenty dollars per share when it was selling at thirty-five dollars when he was passing on its listing on the New York Stock Exchange. He had a very difficult time. I felt rather sorry for him but he was wrong. The movies,notified me that the pictures of the Missouri people here last week would be shown for my benefit at Keith's next week, so I can decide for myself whether to go to Hollywood. Tell Margie that the Vice President sent me a fine picture of himself for her all autographed to her by him. I'll send it to her.\n\n                Ed McKim left yesterday afternoon after having what he claimed was a grand visit. I'm glad Roger and all of 'em enjoyed themselves.

Burke, who is sitting beside me while I write this, says his daughter is much better.\n\n                We have been listening to various things in the Senate.

We sold Walsh and some Republican Congressmen, Dirksen of Illinois, Moss of Minnesota, Church of Illinois, and Scott Lucas a Democrat of Illinois. It was a rather boresome affair and I got home at ten o'clock and went to bed. Have been over here at the office since nine o'clock getting more straightening up done. Mr. Trimble was in to see me. He is head of F.H.A. in Kansas City. Mr. Henderson just called me and I'm going out there for dinner. They still seem to want me. It is always nice out there.

Maybe you'd better not tell mamma.\n\n           I got two letters yesterday and none today. Maybe I'll get two tomorrow.

Mrs. Nally is going to try and find us one in Sedgwick so I guess we'll have some place to stay.\n\n           Just had a wire from Pathe News that the inauguration pictures of the Missouri crowd were now being shown in the home state.

I wired him I'd arrive in St. Louis Friday and that I had to be in Independence Saturday. Haven't heard further from him. He's getting scared. I'm glad you went to see Aunt Ella.\n\nI finally got the Gov to the Pres and he had to leave his cohorts behind just as I told him he would. He's a perfect pussy footer and had,talked to two or three Congressmen as well as me. The Pres wouldn't talk to anyone but the Gov and the Senator so the rest had to wait outside. We got what we went after however, and I had a very pleasant conversation with the President. He's not very happy over Mr. Clark's performance in Missouri.\n\nHe shook hands with Cong Cochran and Cong Cannon and McKetterick and Dwight Brown and then told them that he wanted to talk to the Gov and me and they waited outside. After the conference I had to go to the Willard and see forty girls from Christian College who were having lunch there. Then went to the House dining room and had lunch with all the Mo Congressmen and some of their wives and the Gov and his party. Mrs. Cochran told me she wasn't yet sure who had the baby.

I have been kicking myself because I didn't let Sen. Wheeler and his committee go hang and get on that special and come home. I was also afraid it wouldn't get through and after Clark canceled his reservations on the regular train and got on the special I couldn't do it. It would have been taken for an obvious attempt on my part to keep him and the St. Louis gang from the Gov. and I don't want to do that. If the Gov can't stay with his real friends the sooner we know it the better. They are making a great play to have him line up with St. Louis. I think however he is man enough not,to do it.\n\n          As I told you yesterday Eddie KcKim came in yesterday and we had a fine visit with Burke and the V.P. I asked Garner to autograph a picture of his for Margaret and he is going to do it. Mrs. Garner asked about you and hoped you'd be here soon. Then we spent all yesterday afternoon playing penny anti [sic] over at the hotel. Had Vic and Bud, Burke the Pathe News men who took the pictures of the inauguration the hotel manager and one or two other had a grand time and no one lost much or gained much either. Mrs. Griggs went home last night and I think had a grand time. She did not bother me much and appeared to be very grateful for what had been done. Haven't seen Mrs. Bates.

The Woodlea is right across the street from the Kennedy-Warren and is a nice place.\n\nWith the schools as they are there you'd as well come on here. I'm mighty sick of hotels.

[/letterhead] \nJan. 23, 1937\n\nDear Bess:  I thought maybe you might like to see my smooth stationary. It came this morning. I ordered a hundred sheets charged against my stationary account for special use. I think I told you I listened to the inaugural from my private office over the radio. I'll be most happy to do anything I can for Natalie's sister. What should I do? Take them to the Senate lunchroom to lunch send them to the White House, Bureau of Engraving and have Bud take 'em to Arlington. The Senatorial reception to the Senate is that day but I don't suppose I could get 'em in to that,Mrs. Cochran is still the reception committee. Cannon was running the show however because Stark lives in his district. You guessed right on the dignity.\n\n          You know what I did yesterday. I went to sleep and forgot to go to the Henderson's wedding. I was so tired after all that Missouri crowd coming over and over and listening to all their tales of woe and trying to entertain them and trying not to take a drink with every one of them that I just forgot the wedding. Do you suppose they'll be at outs with me? I hope not for I like them very much. I was so disgusted when I found what I'd done that I didn't go to a big dinner at the Mayflower to which I had a special invitation and over which Paul McNutt presided. I just went back over to the hotel and lay and wished I'd gotten on that train and gone home.\n\n           Eddie McKim came this morning and will stay over until tomorrow so that will to some extent alleviate the homesickness and the wish for you and Margie. I'm all right, feel fine and you need not worry about me. There are so many people looking after me I can't go wrong. Kiss Margie.

I went down to Garfinckel's and bought me a new collar and tie, so I ought to be in the right fix. I'd be happy if an earthquake or a fire or something would make it impossible for me to get there, but no such things ever happen when they are badly needed.\n\nI am very sorry I forgot to put that special delivery stamp on the Friday letter. I won't forget again. Had dinner and a most pleasant conversation with Dr. Smith last,night. He gave me an exact duplicate of George Washington's penknife, which he purchased at Alexandria Lodge. I was very pleased with it. I gave him a new penny for it.\n\nHad lunch with Bill Hicks today and he said he'd had a pleasant conversation with you over the phone. I've been having a grand time at my subcommittee meeting. McKellar and Wheeler had a tilt today, as well as the P.O. and the Interstate Commerce Commission.

Yesterday was a banner day - I got two letters but the day before none so that made it even. George was right on the shoes. They came on time and I'll bet a hat they wouldn't have by air mail. It was as much my fault as yours that they were forgotten. I thought I'd left 'em here.\n\nPowell Grover sent you a most beautiful orchid for the Mo party. It is still in the ice box. I told the girls that the first one that went to a party could wear it. Maybe you'd rather I'd send it to you. Mrs. Stark had on one like it last night when the train,left so I suppose he sent one to you, Mrs. Clark and Mrs. Stark. I didn't see any on Mrs. Clark the night of the Mo Party. I went down to the train last night and had dinner with Roger and Mrs. Sermon on the train before it pulled out. Went through and told everyone good-bye. I met 'em and saw 'em off. Bennett didn't meet 'em but he went back with them on the train. I wish I had but there is so much to do here and I could only stay one day. When I come I want to stay at least a week.\n\n                  Made a speech on my bill over the radio last night. Sent you a telegram about it. Hope you all stay well now. I am not entirely settled in my new place yet. They are going to give me another room I hope that's bigger and then we can talk about decorating it.  Kiss Margie.

I'm always for the new arrivals. It's one of our principal reasons for being here I think. Some thousand generations from now we may arrive at perfection.\n\n           That fever business alarms me. I'll try to get a place to stay and you and Margota can come on here. That's what you should have done from Biloxi any way.

If Senator Robinson and Senator Neeley hadn't voluntarily come to my rescue I'd have been really up against it. Senator Robinson sent me over ten of his tickets because there were very few here from Arkansas and Senator Neeley sent me two. I didn't ask them, it was voluntary. Wasn't that nice? Dick Duncan helped me out too he gave me some Ways and Means Committee seats about eight altogether and I managed about six from the Sgt at Arms so you see I really took care of some thirty odd people. I don't know what Shannon and Bell did with their seats. I haven't yet met anyone who got one from either of them. Clark of course had St. Louis on,hand and did as well as could be expected I guess. The new Congressman Anderson also sent me one ticket. But it rained and rained and nearly all the seats were empty. Clark and I came back to my office and listened to the performance over the radio.\n\n                 Went to a cocktail party given by the Mayor of St. Louis at 6:30 at the Washington Hotel and then to dinner at 7:00 at the Willard with Mrs. Margaret Sheppard and her nice son Cong Bell, Mr. and Mrs. Maloney and Mrs. Swofford, and Emmett and Mrs. O'Malley. It was a very nice meal. Then we went upstairs to the Mo Society. I had on tails, tall hat and all. It was a grand reception. They stood the Colonels all up in line and about a thousand shook their hands. The Governor I think enjoyed it. Mrs. Vic, Mrs. Bud and Mrs. Swofford helped at my box. We had all the old ladies and all the cripled [sic] ones there in our seats including Mrs. Loose.\n\n                   I'm most happy you have everybody up and around. Please keep 'em that way.

No letter yesterday but I thought I'd better go to the hotel before I called and the special had come. I've a good notion to call F.D. tomorrow and tell him I don't want to be at his dinner party. I'll send John or somebody up with the cards if I go. There are people I know who would give plenty to get such an invitation - but I don't give a damn about [inserted]  it  [/inserted] and would much rather spend the time at the office studying the hearings on the aviation bill.\n\n            I'll take care of the dollar to Mrs. Burke and also Mrs. Luxich. If we charged Mrs. Williams with that hotel bill on Monday night she'd owe us,about five dollars if I held out all the bills. Wonder what she thinks three people can stay at the Hotel Biloxi for - about three dollars I guess. Wish Mrs. Luxich hadn't mentioned it.\n\n            I got a letter from Margie yesterday and sent her one and some funny papers. I also forgot to put a special on your Fridays letter so you won't get it today. I guess Helms article will create a disturbance. You'd better send me the clipping. We get the paper but sometimes the articles are cut.\n\n            I'm going to dinner with Fred at noon, Maloney and Bell tonight, 1600 Pa Ave Tuesday, and Oscar and Elsie Wednesday.

They sent me a ticket today. You should have had a real letter from me yesterday. The cards were left at the hotel. I really think I'll get Fred's matter fixed up all right. The executive manager and the Washington representatives will be in to see me tomorrow. I am hoping I can get what I want. I usually do.\n\n           I had the greatest compliment paid me today. Senator Robinson called up and sent me ten extra tickets to the inauguration. And Senator Neely sent me two. I had made an agreement with my colleague to divide our extras and I sent him his half. But I felt very highly complimented that Robinson would think of me, and that Neely should makes me feel very good indeed. I saw Mrs. Duncan, Mrs. Cochran,Mrs. Zimmerman and Mrs. Emily Newal Blair all at the House lunch for Gov Stark. They were all very much interested in when you were coming. I am enclosing you a Star picture of me and the Gov and some others. I went to meet him. Bennett said no one had met him in Kansas City or Jeff Cy when he went there and he didn't feel like meeting anyone here. The Pathe News people took my picture with Stark and when he sees it he'll be sorry he wasn't there. I am making a National Broadcast speech Thursday at 5:00 to 5:15 on my bill.

Said she would send your card directly to Independence. I am terribly distressed too that you are not here, and getting more so all the time. I'm still looking for an apartment bargain and if I find one you are coming. Glad you had a good time at Katura's party. You should be in the Governor's reception room at 11:30 Monday and tell the Adj. Gen., Claude Earp that you are there so he can properly seat you.\n\nGuffey's office called me about the reception and told me that he is anxious for me to come and I told him I hadn't had an invitation and he sent me another one. I sent Catherine up to his private secretary with your note of acceptance,because they wouldn't have gotten it if I'd mailed it. I guess I'll have to put on my nigger preacher suit as Jimmy Birnes [sic] calls it. I was supposed to go to a luncheon for Sam Rayburn at one o'clock today but the manager of this new place across the street called me and gave me a fine lunch and showed me the place. I may move into it. They have lovely rooms and their two room suites are perfect. There is a bed room with twin beds and the couch in the living room opens up into a double bed. Then there is a kitchenette in the wall with ice box and everything and it's all brand new but higher than it ought to be - from 85.00 for a single room to 170.00 for two rooms.

It does not hold enough. I am being terribly besieged for tickets to the President's show, and I've just received a list of Stark's trainload and have been tearing my hair ever since. There won't be half of them at the show because we can't fit 'em in. Otto Higgins, Powell Grover, Henry McElroy, Jr., Bill Kitchen, Dick Nacy are all on the train and every bloomin' one of 'em will want a ticket. Well it's just too bad. They'll have to get mad I guess. I gave O'Malley and will give Roger two apiece, gave Mrs. Griggs one and,Mrs. Henderson two, gave Mrs. Boone one and Mrs. Swofford one, and you can see what I have left. You know I had to buy thirty-three dollars worth of tickets to the Missouri Society affair. Every member of the delegation had to do that and then they gave us a box. Mrs. Swofford and Vic's and Bud's wives are going to help me take care of my fifteen colonels at the ball. Now aren't you sorry you're not here? I wish most sincerely I wasn't. I'm glad you told me what you sent each of the newlyweds.\n\nI'd have come home this Saturday if it were not for the ice on the mountains and the floods in Indiana and Ohio.

We boarded the train at 6:30 Tuesday night, had dinner in a private car - [underlined] and went to bed[/underlined]. Got up at 5 A.M. and drove out to a private preserve belonging to Col. Kaul a rich lumber man. He owns 33000 acres and there are plenty of deer. It was a beautiful place right in the Allegheny Mtns northeast of Pittsburg. We had breakfast at the Lodge, and beautiful country home really in a valley with a trout stream in the front yard, and then everyone put on all the clothes he had and could borrow and went up in the woods and sat down by a fire to wait for 'em to drive the deer by. The V.P. shot one, Guffey \"shot at\" two and so did Murray and one or two,others but one was all that was killed. Hatch, Duffy, Herring, Minton, Neeley, Murray, the V.P. and the Polish Ambassador were the party - and copious newspapermen and photographers. Just a publicity stunt, but a lot of fun. I walked several miles and it did me good. It was a clear beautiful day and I'm sure everyone enjoyed it. We left last night at ten o'clock and got back here at 7:50 this morning. I came over here found a letter, for which I was happy and am writing you before I go to the hotel to put on a clean shirt. Glad to get the Post clipping. It will make the Governor squirm I imagine. Hope you got your shopping done. Here's a check if it isn't enough I'll send another.\n\nKiss Margey. Love to you. \nHarry,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C.

I walked from seven fifteen until eight and then came in here and sorted over the mail hoping I'd get a letter from both you and Margey. I guess it will be in the next mail. So far I haven't missed getting one all this week. Be careful on those slick pavements. We've been very lucky lately and in times past on accidents and sickness too for that matter and I hope we continue that way. I was so lonesome last night I didn't know what to do. So I just went to bed. We are going to quit Dec. 22 so I'll be home for Christmas. Then we can start back as soon,as we can and get things lined up for our living quarters before the Congress convenes. I'm sure you'll like it. The living room has windows on the north and on the west. It looks over the park and Mass. Ave. There's only one drawback - the kitchen has no windows, but it has a fan to take out the heat. It is electric anyway so I guess there won't be much heat.\n\n           Just finished an interview with Franklin editor of the negro paper the Call. Jim Wachter is waiting so I'll have to run.

[/letterhead]  \nTuesday Mar 10 '37\n\nDear Bess:-  Well I got in exactly on time yesterday morning. Vic tried to meet me but failed. He was ten minutes late and I was at the office when he got to the depot. I found at least a thousand letters here on all sorts of subjects - about half about Mrs. Roosevelt and the Court.\n\nBennett, I suppose will be in Kansas City Saturday. I told him if he was looking for a split in the Democratic Party he could very easily find it and perhaps now is as good a time as any to have it. His face got redder than it was and he said very emphatically that he,was not looking for a party split but evidently the Republicans were and so was Roosevelt whom he proceeded to blame for the condition. Same old story - he does not like the President.\n\nGot my committee started off and will get through Thursday. If I get a wire from you I'll be on my way to go with you to Mississippi. I rather think it is the thing to do. I'm getting jittery and maybe a chance to sit down a minute would help.\n\nKiss Margie. I'm looking for a letter today. You won't get one until Thursday.\nLove to you  Harry\nThe stay at  home was all  too short.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 6 MAR 10 4-PM 1937\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n                                                                                                                       \nMrs. Harry S.

I guess we are about due. It wouldn't surprise me if it doesn't save up a good one for us when we start back to Washington January 1.\n\n               I had dinner with Jim Nugent last night. He is a very clever person and I like him but just the same he's a railroad lobbyist. He was very careful not to ask me any very leading questions but I could tell that he is here for the C.M. & St. Paul because he knew me. I'll take all the dinners he has to put out and then do what I think is,right. I can see no harm in talking to any one-no matter what his background. In fact I think everyone has a right to be heard if you expect to get all the facts. Of course it is the job of some people to befog the issue and cover up the facts. I don't put Jim in that class.\n\n           I'm having dinner with Vic and another old lobbyist tonight-Colonel Stephenson by name. He's with the Pennsylvania Railroad and a very agreeable gentleman, but I am sure I know what he wants-but in spite of that I'll have a very pleasant evening discussing national defense.\n\n           Will try to see some furniture this afternoon if the Senate doesn't work too late.

I sat up and read the debates in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 last night. It was in terrible print and I have a headache today, both from the print and the debates.\n \nI am getting some awfully dirty letters from some of my constituents but I don't care. Some of them are funny and some of 'em need a punch in the nose. But I suppose that is part of the game. When everything is over and done with we'll wonder why we were so wrought up about it. I'm going to vote for the increase regardless of what they say about it.,It is my opinion however that it won't reach a vote. Some sort of compromise will be reached I think where some of the Court will retire and we'll vote on an amendment. They have just sent me another carload of books from the Library of Congress. Time I wade though them I'll either know it all or I don't know anything.\n\nHope I get a letter before the day is over.

That's the first miss in a long time. I guess maybe you had a right to miss one since I missed on Wednesday. But I had no chance on that trip.\n\n               It is cold as real winter this morning and I used it as an excuse to get up half-hour late and miss my walk. Yesterday was a real day's work. I put the biggest rail receivership attorneys in the United States through a real grilling and practically told 'em they ought to be tried for unethical practices. I am sure the big corporations will never want,anything to do with me any more. But they sick their high-hat bar associations on some little ambulance chaser when he's trying to get bread for his family, and the attorneys for the National City Bank and Kuhn, Loeb and Co. can fix a federal court, tell receivers and trustees what to do, and practically shut out all other lawyers from a $700 million bankruptcy-and they are all right. I told'em they were no better than the little shysters, and they are not.\n\n           Here is a letter from Mrs. Garner. I opened it because I thought I might have to phone her you weren't here. Mr. Shoop is having a cocktail party tomorrow night and I am invited. What do you think of that? Had a letter from the governor asking us to stay at the mansion at the first opportunity. Maybe he thinks that appeals to a country boy.

[/letterhead] \nJan. 7. 1937\n\nDear Bess:-  Do you recognize this stationary? It is some you gave me from Kramer's years ago. In cleaning up I found it in a box of medals, lodge cards, military orders and Masonic books that hadn't been opened since we arrived. Was most happy to get your note from the City Club, and I'm sure you had a fine time. Mrs. O'Malley was very nice to give you a luncheon. I kind of like him in spite of some of the things he does and I'm trying to help iron out his situation.\n\nThe old sun of a gun who owned that apartment or the lease on it would not let me have it. His wife would, but he only wanted to let it for three months and $200 rent. I am,sure she would have let me have it for $150.00 and six months, in fact she said as much. Whenever I do run into one you are coming if it is April 1. I never was so disappointed because I thought I had it. Even sent you a description of it. I've been spending today cleaning up. They fixed me up a nice sitting room next to my office and even moved in an icebox. It belonged to the nurse across the hall and she put a crepe ribbon around it when they moved it in to me.\n\nI thought I'd lost your picture but found it very carefully put away in the bottom drawer. Wouldn't that have been a calamity. The note you sent with it to Ft. Sill is in the back of it. Well I'm about to cry, so you kiss Margie.\n\n Harry,[printed]                                          [circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C. 7 JAN 7 330PM 1937\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nHarry S.

Glad Ethel is better. Hope your club went off in good shape. I haven't heard about Stark resigning. He probably would if he could climb into the cabinet. Before I forget it Gardellis have a seven pound black haired boy. Vic asked him whom he suspected and his reply was \"it's a good thing it isn't red haired.\"\n\n                  I'll be glad to see the clippings from the scandle [sic] sheet. I hadn't seen Mr. Shoop's effusion either so I'm glad you sent it. They are using every means to protest Mr. Milligan even being nice to me. I'm going out to Shoop's to,a cocktail party this afternoon. I suppose I'll see Mr. Clark, Col Ristine and Mrs. [scratched out] Elm [/scratched out] Emily Newal Blair and all the rest of them. But I'll probably enjoy it at that.\n\n                   I'm having quite a time with the St. Paul hearing - all the witnesses have sick relatives and want to go home. I want to let them but I can't very well stop the hearing. A newspaper man sent me a note yesterday saying \"The government holds the railroads while the big bankers pick their pockets and the lawyers stand off the police.\" That's about the situation in a nutshell. We're stuck on the farm bill. I don't believe the extra session will do a thing.

Whenever labor and hours come up he's against labor and for unlimited hours. My father was the same way. They honestly believe that every man ought to have to work from daylight to dark and that the boss ought to have all the profit. My sympathies have been all the other way, and that is the reason for my lack of worldly goods. I just can't cheat in a trade or browbeat a worker. Maybe I'm crazy but so is the Sermon on the Mount if I am.\n\nMy correspondence is getting bigger and bigger. Mr. Dominick thought he'd put me in a hole I guess but he didn't.,He really had no right to publish my letter because it is my property. It was nice of Red Sands to send you another bunch of roses. I'll try and get your dress changed and bring it out with me. I sure hate to come on the train but I guess I'll have to because I can't get back if I don't. Just had an invitation from the Sec. of War to a reception for the President of the Phillipines. Told him I couldn't go. It was for March 2nd and I hope I won't be here.

It is cold, the sun is shining and there were letters from both you and Margaret. I'm ashamed to say I haven't seen Oscars baby except at the hospital. If I can manage it I'll go out there tomorrow. I'm sending flowers to the Gardelli's today. Good thing you mentioned it. If you think you can do better on lamps there and they can be conveniently transported why go ahead and get them. If not we can get 'em here same as everything else. I haven't had a chance to see any of the furniture people yet.

My didn't they romp on Roger. I understand that the next edition will be in my behalf. I told you about Gardelli's and sent flowers two days afterwards. The snow didn't come. It is clear and cold again this morning and I had a fine walk.\n\n                 I have only made one engagement for home week. That's tentatively Monday Dec 27 to install Grandview Lodge. We ought to leave on Wednesday the 29th if we can get ready because Congress meets on Monday Jan 2. We'd get here Friday then and have Saturday and Sunday to get sort of straightened,around and then we could spend the mornings of the next week finishing up. Sen. Glass told me the Appropriations Com. would start about the 5th. I have had a most strenuous time from a work standpoint ever since I've been here but I'm feeling fine, principally because I've spent at least eight hours a day in bed. There's been someone here though nearly every day to bother and interrupt me. So if I don't get your letter off the first thing then I'm stuck. The Committee on rails gets harder all the time, the farm bill is making us all nutty but I guess we'll come out of it. Justice Brandeis invited us to tea Sunday and the Guffeys the next Sunday. Do I have to do anything special except to go? Guffey's tea is for John L. Lewis! Glad Marg's cold is better. I advised her to take the shot. The insurance notices came the A.M. Kiss Margey.

It's worse [ink blot] [penciled inserted] an accident [/penciled inserted] than the Wheeler-Rayburn Bill. The nasty things that some of my \"friends\" have said to me rather hurts sometimes. For instance old man Porter, president of the Power and Light, wrote me the most patronizing letter you ever saw. I burned him to a cinder and mailed it while it was hot. I also let one of my country newspapermen have both barrels, and he came back with sweetest letter you ever saw. I burned him to a cinder and mailed it while it was hot. No it wasn't Mr. Southern. This fellow's up at Maysville. The thing that makes me stronger than ever,for F.D.R. is that most of these smart alecks tell me I'd better line up with Bennett. Well what would you do if you really believed the plan is right but the approach is wrong. The only thing about it I don't like was his approaching it on a subterfuge. He should have just plainly stated that the count is fossilized on an 1884 basis and then said let's give it some new blood by appointing two or three young men on it. That's what the issue is and that's all it will ever be. Harlan, Clark, Holmes, Stone--all the great dissenters warned of this very situation. The Count has become the bulwark of Hooverism and reaction. They're not immortal nor infallible so why not do the job in a straight forward way.\n\nKiss Margie, love to you, \n Harry,[penciled scribbling over entire envelope, front]\n\n [circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 6 FEB 21  8-PM 1937\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n                                                                                                                       \nMrs. Harry S.

Didn't sleep very well because I was weak enough to drink a lot of coffee for supper. Jim Nugent and I went together at the Carlton. Went to bed at nine o'clock and read for a couple of hours then slept for three hours and read for another hour or two. Woke up again at six and got up. The letter wasn't in the first mail but I guess it will come later.\n\n                 Vic and I are going to look at furniture this morning and if possible see Mrs. Gardelli's baby. The Senate meets at eleven and I have a date with the Pres. at that hour too. Cannon is giving a luncheon for the Gov. at 1:30 and Mrs.,Alford is having a party at four for Roy Roberts. If the Senate is in session I can't go to that. Landon was in the Senate cloak room yesterday and Capper asked me to go and meet him, which I did. I asked Clark if he'd been informed officially of Stark's visit and he said he hadn't but he guessed he go to Cannon's lunch, so I'll have to.\n\n        Geo. Haworth the Mo. Social Security Secretary is having dinner with me tonight and tomorrow I go to tea at Judge Brandeis'. Was nice of him to call me wasn't it? Evidently he likes my rail spasms. You were asked too.\n\n        I'm trying to get the President to release the money for the teacher's colleges at Maryville and Kirksville. Don't think he will. If he should do it today the Gov. would probably assume that his visit did it. Every Missourian I've seen including his job holders, hopes that he'll be made Mr. Secretary as soon as possible.

I wanted to be there so badly to help you celebrate I don't know how to express it.  If your new dress doesn't fit you, send it back and we'll get a larger one.\n\nI'm glad you went to Mrs. Strickler's luncheon for Mrs. Boxley.  I rather think it is better to pay no attention to the childish actions of people anyway.  The more I watch the behavior of my colleague, the more I'm impressed with the necessity of that attitude.  He is so thoroughly impressed with his importance and dignity that he is continually,offending people and continually being offended.  It will be very hard for him at home next time even with all of us for him if some smart campaigner comes out against him.  It might wake him up though if someone did.  He is against the President on the Court issue, as was to be expected.  I honestly believe that this issue will split both the old parties, and I'm of the opinion that this is what F.D.R. wants.  He, you know, reads a lot of history and I think would like to be a Monroe, Jackson, and Lincoln all in oneâand is probably succeeding.  Only history will tell.\n\nWell more good wishes.

I am somewhat doubtful about sending that furniture out without your seeing it first, and also I have always wanted to shop for it with my gal as every other person has done from Adam down. But for some reason we've never been able to do what everybody else takes for granted.\n\n           Had lunch with the governor yesterday and he seemed to enjoy it very much. He gave an interview to Helm, which if true puts quite a different view on some things. Maybe I can straighten him out yet. If I could only be at home, I know that could be done.\n\n           I'm going to a football game this morning between the House pages,and the Senate pages at Catholic University stadium. Hope the Senate boys win but I'm afraid they won't.\n\n         Old Man Norris came up to me yesterday and said that he thought my rail hearing was the highlight of the special session. I almost went out because he's hardly spoken to me since I've been here. I guess he did it because his colleague had told the New York Sun that is was time wasted.\n\n         I'm going to make a speech on it in the Senate before we adjourn and let the country and everyone else know just what is the trouble with railroad financing anyway. It probably will catalogue me as a radical but it will be what I think.

Wouldn't my friends, who know my love for cigarettes, have a grand time wondering how much it takes to buy me.  I'm glad you are all well, so am I and I expect to stay that way.  I'm going to Oscar and Elsie's for dinner tonight.  There has been considerable flu here but it doesn't seem to be the fatal kind.  You'll get a small package from Mr. Julius Garfinckel's along about Saturday, your seventy-second birthday or maybe it's your thirty second - haven't kept very close count on it.

There ought to be another one on Sunday. I think you are right about the lamps. I'm sure we can do as well here and not take a chance on breaking them. Hope Margaret didn't take any more cold.

I walked about,two miles this morning and never did get warmed up, so you know it was cold.\n\n        Justice Brandeis' tea was really a tea. A Mrs. January sat a little table and made each individual guest a cup and each one sat and drank it and then another came up. She said she was formerly from St. Louis and she seemed to be a very nice person-but I wanted to say whoa January when my cup was full. We always called the mules January. The Justice spent more time with me than any of his other guests and seemed very much interested in what we are doing to the railroad and insurance companies. Both he and Mrs. Brandeis are as nice as they can be. I wish you'd been here to go. It was a rather exclusive and brainy party. I didn't exactly belong but they made me think I did.

It is very interesting. I had a short one from Leighton in the same mail. Felton Watson is working in the Dept of Justice. I don't suppose it's a promotion. I think he got the job that Leighton wanted. Catherine mailed the Post the day your letter came. It should have been there last,Saturday. Don't fail to read the speeches of McKeller and Ashurst in the record. McKeller's was last Wednesday and Ashurst's yesterday.\n\n         I went to the Reserve Officers dinner last night and Sen Sheppard made one of the best speeches I've heard on National Defense. Woodring made a good one too. A Congressman from Alabama waved the flag and made a Tom Heflin oratorical speech but when he was done we wondered what he'd said. I sat with Cong. Anderson, Bob Reed and Gen Westover chief of air service. Craig seemed most happy to see me too. Sens Duffy, Thomas, Utah who is a reserve officer, Lundeen, Bulkley and one or two others were there.

I'm sorry the dress was too little. Maybe you'd better send it to me to exchange and I'll get one as nearly like it as possible or exchange it for stockings or gloves or something else if you'd rather have it.\n\n            I had a good dinner at Vic's place. Betty and Stewart were there too. Vic and Mrs. Vic and I went to look at some houses in the afternoon. We found one on the D.C. line at Albermarle St. that was very, very nice. It is white brick on a big lot on the corner of two streets looking south with,big trees all around. It is about two blocks from Mass. Ave. and no stranger in town could find it except with a guide. It had a beautiful living and dining room on the first floor. Three bedrooms lots of closets and a finished basement with a maid's room, double garage in basement two porches and one upstairs. There are fireplaces in the basement, living room and big bedroom upstairs. There's only one objection. It is in Maryland and rather far out. Hope you stay well and that the time will finally arrive when you can come.\n                  \nKiss Margie.

You may get a phone call from me to come at once because I'm about to rent an apartment at the Kennedy-Warren for the season. It has two bedrooms, two baths, a large living room, and good kitchen and half a dining room-with gas and lights furnished-and I'm offering $150.00 per month for it. If I get it, you had just as well start packing and I'll be after you Sunday. You just don't know how lonesome it is when I think you're not comming at,all. I am enclosing you a letter from Mr. Harris which was opened by mistake and one from Margie's school which was opened on purpose.\n\n                      Hope you get your invitation to lunch with Mrs. President. I thought maybe you'd be here in time to go if I get the apartment.\n\n                      We opened up yesterday with all the pomp and circumstance that the Senate can stir up. The only stir was caused when Senator Neely walked down by himself, and the two Florida Senators tried to maneuver for seniority. They swore 'em both in at once, so Florida has no senior Senator.\n\n                        Love to you both, Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: WASHINGTON, D.C.

I've been working in the appropriations committee all morning on first one thing and then another. Radio and Federal Trade business mostly. We had Stewart McDonald up a couple of days ago and the Home Owners Loan yesterday. It will take all next week to get done with it.\n\n          I was glad to get your letter and so was Bud. I asked what he was doing getting letters from my wife and have threatened to write to Sharon. He gave me permission. I am going to dinner with Vic,and Mrs. Messall at Col Stevenson's tonight. He is a Penn. R.R. representative here and is trying to get Vic to have the Little Congress go to New York over the Penn R.R. Vic says they will go that way anyway but we'd as well have the dinner.\n\n            I have never changed my mind on the Court and have never made but one statement on it, and that was to the New York Times on Tuesday, and they printed it as I sent it and the Star copied it word for word. There is no use trying to straighten it out. It would only make it worse. As you know they'd like to make me out a know-nothing but I don't believe they can. Hope you had a nice birthday. Where is Margie's letter? Kiss her anyway.  Love to you,         \n Harry,[multiple, circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C.

I sure want to go to a picture show or two with you and Margey but this devilish hearing is getting really into a bog. We had Mr. George Whitney and S. Parker Gilbert before us yesterday. Mr. Whitney is very much inclined to feel his position. He came to my office at about a quarter to ten and told me what he was going to do. I simply asked him who the chairman of the committee happened to be and he immediately dismounted and went along like a gentleman.,I'm in an awful fix. We must get done before the session starts and it looks as if I'll have hearings right up to Friday night. I've wired the 35th Division I can't get to Lawrence on the 11th and I'm writing Vivian today and sending him my speech for the Washington Twp meeting. If you and Marg can go to the foot ball game you ought to go because I can't get there.\n\nIf I quit this thing now, they'll say that Kemper and the Boss pulled me off, and I'm going to go through with it if I don't get home at all. It is a mess and has created a terrible furor in New York. Guaranty Trust and J. P. Morgan have used every means available to make me quit. I'm going to finish the job or die in the attempt. I sure hate it but you can see where I am.

The sun is shining beautifully here and then I saw in the paper that it is frozen up out there again and I gave up the idea. I could have taken the train but the least I can do it for would be over one,hundred dollars and we need those dollars too much. So I sent you a little present. Mrs. Messall advised me on it and I hope you like it.\n\n           I played hookey from the Appropriations committee this morning and went to the War College to hear a lecture on Robert E. Lee by Dr. Freeman. He's the man,who wrote the four-volume life of Lee that John Snyder gave me. I think he gave one of the greatest talks I ever heard.\n\n         I wish I could talk to you about putting our daughter's picture in the paper. Of course I'm complimented and proud that they should want to, but will it have any undesirable effect upon her? She, I'm sure, will have all her mamma's common sense but I wouldn't like to give her a publicity complex too young. You know what happened to Mary McElroy. If you want to print it, go ahead. Your judgment in the matter is better than mine. Hope the sofa came out all right. Did you ever get my watch?

Mr. Wheeler had his committee together examining the Guaranty Trust Company about the Van Swearingen affair. Then Clark and I finally got together on Judge Collet. Mr. Shoup was very sore because the Post outguessed him. I'm not sorry they did. Clark gave it away to them. He told Helm he thought we'd get together and Helm took a chance on it. Mr. Shoup was feeling very bitter.\n\nThis is a grand morning even if it is misty and foggy outside. I just got a letter from you and one from Margie. It makes things so much better. I was sort of worried because someone tried to call me last night and then canceled the call before I got to answer it. It was from Kansas City, but I've,an idea it was about the Federal Judge. Well I have a telegram of two pages from Leighton Shields wanting a two thousand dollar raise in salary! Now beat that if you can. If he doesn't like it he can come home. I can't get that done when he's hardly landed.\n\n           I am going over to see the Carroll Arms again today and may move if they meet the Continental price. It's all so new and lean and there's a tub and shower in every room. The closets are bigger and better too. Mr. Ford himself came to see me. He has the Lafayette to.\n\n            You are going to buy those wedding presents aren't you? I called Mrs. Henderson and told her I'd give her two tickets to the inauguration and it pleased her to death. I gave Mrs. Bowe yours and I'm giving Mrs. Swofford one and I'll have eight for Stark and his Colonels. Glad you sent him a wire. They gave me twelve tickets for the show. Bud just came in and said the call was from you. Now isn't that terrible. I was in Baltimore in the bath. If you'd called the Lord Baltimore I'd have answered.

He looks fine and seems to be in the best of health. He is very much put out with the Gov. He says that Stark asked Jim P to come to Jeff City and work a number of Democrats on the list he had. Jim made the trip and worked seven - and not one was appointed on the election board. I don't understand that brand of politics. Evidently he wanted to be sure that we'd have no friends on the board. You remember how he hounded me for help when,he was trying for the job. Conditions evidently have changed. You should have had a letter every day for I haven't missed. Glad you got the letter about the Stone girl. Hope Margey doesn't work too hard. But I'm very certain that she'll do the job creditably. Here's a letter from Mrs. Bill Taylor. I opened it by \"mistake\" and read it. I really didn't notice the address until it was opened.\n\n             Sorry I can't attend unless it is the Saturday before the 14th. I've decided I'd better come home and introduce the President's wife and fly back if I can. It seems to be the 13th so we can go if you want to.

But it will probably mean two for tomorrow so I'll try to stand it. This has been the hottest day and I got a real sunburn so Jozak says. It was good to talk with you yesterday. Snyder, Vaughan, Kirby and I were all in the hotel at once. The first two and I went to a polo game over on the west end of the reservation at nine o'clock. It wasn't very good because everyone on the team on both teams in fact were at a party at the same polo club given in my honor. I had to leave at ten o'clock so the Gen. and his wife could go home. They told me I missed the best of the party but I was glad to go to bed myself. Jozak and I left together. The party was given by Major Green the commander of the regular artillery battalion stationed here. He's a very fine fellow.,I was up at 5 A.M. this morning. Mrs. Linbacker and her Major husband had Snyder, Vaughan, Jozak and me to dinner yesterday. She is a sister of Col. Fred Apt of Iola Kans. who was with us on Col Rumsey's party in St. Louis. Mrs. Lininger the wife of the Asst Commandant here told me that Mrs. Linbacker is a Carter of Va on her mother's side, so I brought the conversation around at dinner and found that she is. We came out to camp at four o'clock and started a W.P.A. poker and I quit at seven thirty, took a bath and went to bed at 8 o'clock.\n\n                  The mess gets better every day and it was excellent to start with. (I'm getting undeserved credit for that too).\n\n                  I've got to go watch a shrapnel problem at 7:30 and it is nearly that time. Kiss Margie.

I hope you'll notice the absence of Bill Taylor who should have been there. I think they wanted to indicate that they are for me and not the Gov. so Bill wasn't asked. The papers say the Gov. and his staff will be the guests of Mo Society on the 14th. Aren't you sorry you're not here? I'll be on the road to New Orleans and thank goodness and I wouldn't go if I were here.\n I've been interviewed by every newspaperman in Washington and they all acted like they were glad to see me.\nKiss Margey, love to you.

We drove from Memphis to Rosedale, Mississippi, Tuesday morning where we got aboard the River Commission boat Control.,It is a sternwheeler with two smokestacks and cabins, deck (I'd call it a front porch), as is the General Newton, on which we now are. The Newton is a little bit more luxurious than the Control and can run a little faster. They are both about forty years old and driven by steam power. First thing I did when I got aboard was to go down and inspect the engine room and power plant, which of course pleased the engineer. We came down the river all afternoon looking at levees and cutoffs and dredges and everything else that requires government money to run-including a couple of generals, numerous colonels, an admiral, and some working soldiers. The river work is under the direction of the army engineers. The admiral has charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey,work and the rest of 'em are all enthusiastic River Control men.\nThe meals are sumptuous. Expect to gain about seven pounds. Tuesday night we pulled up to the River bank on the Mississippi side and Senator Thomas and the Secretary of the Commission took an auto for Jackson where they caught a train for New Orleans. Elmer had to make a speech on the Commodity Dallas. I've heard him make it four,[letterhead]                                                                                 \nMississippi River Commission  Vicksburg, Miss.

After he left Senator Overton, his son John an engineer General by the name of Tyler (who is a Connecticut Tyler and not a Va. one), a couple of Colonels the Admiral and myself decided that we'd take a short course in probabilities the studies to end at one A.M. Well for some reason,I became the instructor after a couple of hours and quit with nearly all the chips. We repeated last night and I'm still winner which is a record for me.\n\n              Ross Collins and William Whittington (I want to call him Dick and ask about the cat)-two Congressman from Mississippi-are along and I find that Ross isn't such a bad boy as the papers make out. He took me on a sight-seeing tour of Natchez yesterday and told me that Natchez would be a fine town if they weren't all living in the past. We saw some of the famous old houses and then got back to the boat. He told me very confidentially that all the riffraff and trash came from Louisiana. Said that his mother always cautioned him to stay away from that state and its people. All this said with a twinkle in,his eye and for the benefit of Senator Overton, who of course resented it vigorously-Collins all the time pretending he was speaking facetiously but afterwards assuring me it was all true-that no respectable Mississippian would associate with Louisiana people.\n\n             We transferred to the Newton Tuesday night while we were tied up and are riding it all the way to the end. \n\n             Will call you when I arrive.

Hope it isn't pouring down rain when the opera starts. It was a barren lonely apartment without you and Margie. I turned on the radio and listened for a while and then went to bed. It came a terrific shower while Vic and Mrs. Messall and I were eating dinner. We ate at the Allies Inn. Then it rained a lot more on the way home. The blinds on the west side and the window sills were pretty wet but the floor was dry. I took a rag and wiped up the water,and everything is all right. Went to see the storage people today. Vic and I called on four of 'em. One, the Security wanted almost twice as much as the Arrow. I'm going to see some more of them tomorrow. There are twenty or thirty of them here. I finally decided after talking to the ones I did talk to to put all the silver in the cedar box and bring it down here. The cussed laundry man didn't come. So I guess I'll have to take it myself in the morning. The reason I know I had to go out to the apt at 2:30 to meet one of the storage men.\n\n            It is a lonesome place. I'll try and leave Friday and get home Sunday if everything is all right here.\n\n               Love to you both Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 19 JUN 20 730PM 1938\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

We left Sen. Swartz there. He is going back on a boat. At Vera Cruz he slipped and fell out of the bath room and hurt his shoulder so he wasn't able to raise his arm up. He was in considerable pain all the way down from there so they sent over to the hospital for an X-ray. No bones broken, but a bad sprain so he decided to wait a couple of days and sail back. He is a most agreeable fellow and we will miss him. He's a lot older than I thought he is - over seventy.\n\nWe have had a most agreeable party on our plane. Gurney, who is just a big kid but a good fellow to be with. Minton and I told him he had no business being a Republican. Then we have Paul Shafer of Michigan another Republican and the life of the party. We are all crazy about him,and call him the Hon. Macklesevarty of Wis. The pictures I sent you are the ones he took. We all are very fond of him. He wrote his wife and told her that if all Democrats were like Minton and myself he'd vote the ticket. I don't need to say anything about Minton - you know him. Then we have an army colonel on leave by the name of Stokely. He [is] a very nice man but has not much to say - maybe he gets no chance to say it. We've also had a drunken Congressman from Maryland by the name of Byron, a perfectly agreeable person when he's conscious. We left him in Salvador because he was so tight he couldn't make the plane. They sent a plane after him and he stayed sober in Panama. Hope he'll continue that way.\n               \nSome of our party went in special planes to Tegucigalpa and we only have Minton and me left in this plane but they'll join us again in Guatemala. We had to send someone so that none of the Banana Republics would be passed up, and we get more bananas from Honduras than anywhere else.\n\nHope you're well and that I'll see you soon.\n\nLove to you Harry.,[handwritten; underlined] Air Mail \n\n[stamp] \nAMERICAN LEGATION \nMANAGUA, NICARAGUA\n\n[stamp]\nAIR MAIL - POR AVION\n\nMrs. Harry S.

It is about eleven miles from here - two miles beyond the end of Connecticut Avenue out in Maryland. It is a lovely place - upon a hill overlooking a new resident district. The Gardellis have a house in the same neighborhood. The house fronts east on a lot 125 ft. front by 160 ft. deep, has a south porch screened in and 20 feet square. There are four rooms on the first floor, living room to the left of center hall as you go in, library on the right paneled in natural wood, kitchen at left and end of the hall and directly behind the living,room, and opening from it by double lattice doors is the dining room. There is a toilet and shower at the right across from the kitchen. It opens into the library and hall too. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms upstairs. It is a lovely place. It ought to be for $16,000. Vic said the payment would be $100 per month. She must have made a single down payment.\nGot the airmail yesterday afternoon. White may be right, you never can tell. Barr and Byam would really make a pair to draw to, what? Hope you got Natalie a coat. Well we are in the midst of a terrific struggle and I hope we answer it for the country's welfare.

We get a delivery on Sunday morning, but it only includes the night's mail so you'd better continue to spend the dime. I'll send the dimes and they are worth the price. I am thinking seriously of going down to Richmond and sleeping over the weekend. I'm way behind you know. Whenever I do that I keep worrying for fear someone from home is sick or something else is wrong so you or some of the rest of the family would want me, and I don't sleep,much more than if I stay here and enjoy the interruptions.\nHere's a lot of scandal. Betty has left Stewart. Vic told me confidentially, so don't remark on it unless they do to you. And - Mrs. M. bought a house while Vic was in Missouri without consulting him. Said she told him he'd spent $8,700 for rent in seven years and she had the money for a down payment and he'd have talked her out of it if she'd told him. The house is way out Northwest somewhere - Vic didn't know the address. Said he guessed they could always sell it if they had to. And - Oscar got drunk again and they fired him for good. Stewart McDonald called me and said they just could, and would, not take him back again. He not only got drunk but ran his car out in Maryland, wrecked it, and got into jail besides. It's a mess but I don't see any way to help him. Thought you'd better hear from me than someone else. Kiss Margie.\nLove to you, Harry,[multiple circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C.

[/letterhead]                      \nThursday 28 1939\n\nDear Bess:-  Well the St. Louis situation was really a pain in the neck. A fellow by the name of Foster, to whom I'd given the 3rd degree on my return from the war and Tom Reynolds from Kansas City, who was present and helped me to start this organization at Grandview in June 1911 and a former Circuit Judge in St. Louis were the organizers of my oposition.,Foster is a civil service employee in the Ry. Mail Service and I could make him most uncomfortable - but I won't. I confered [sic] the degree on him in my lodge with my uniform on in 1919 - before June 28. You'll remember that date.\nBut the boys at Grandview made it so uncomfortable for him he moved his membership to Tom Reynolds lodge in Kansas City. Everyone at Grandview who was entitled to vote was there for me - including Vivian and he'd never been to a Grandview Lodge meeting but once before. He came very nearly whipping Foster.\nNat Jackson, George Marquis and Renick Jones did yeoman service. I'll never forget it. Nat was the angriest man I ever saw after the vote was counted. I had to calm him down by saying what you did - well we won.\n If it hadn't been for the country boys out state they'd have accomplished their object.,Fred Wood, past Imperial Potentate of the Shrine, a black Republican and a friend of Reynolds came up from Springfield to offset him and did. There were 852 votes cast. I got 436. It took 427 to elect. I had nine to spare - but the Grandmaster was elected by 845 votes. If my friends hadn't put forth such an effort for me I'd have told 'em to go to hell with the office - and I almost did anyway. I'm glad now I didn't. 135 St. Louisans left after the count - they were there to beat me. Henry Chiles was about as happy as,[letterhead]                                                            \nUnited States Senate     Washington, D. C. [/letterhead]    \n\nanyone after the count was over. He told me that he didn't know what he'd have done if I'd been beaten because it was in his administration.\nJohn Snyder and Harry Vaughan were much more nervous than I was.\nNow for some good news. Snyder said Ruby Hulen, who is Bill Hirth's attorney was in to see him about some R.F.C. business and told him that he'd never,seen such a change in sentiment on me out state. He expressed the opinion to Snyder that neither Stark nor Milligan could beat me. That's some admission from him.\nDickman and the ward leaders from St. Louis had a meeting and decided not to make any commitments until after Jan 1. Snyder said that this refered [sic] particularly to the Governor's race. Then someone asked about me particularly and everyone there was for me but they let the rule apply. Dickman told the crowd that the present Gov. would embarrass them if he could but he knew I wouldn't. Dickman refused to ride to the Legion Convention on the same train with the Gov. So the political situation is on the mend. I think my victory in the G. Lodge is symbolic because 75% of that organization is Republican.\n Lowell Dyer, one of Harry Jobes',Lieutenants in the war came in today and I'm taking him to dinner tonight.\nVic met me at the airport and was most glad to see me. He's always scared the plane will fall.\nWe'll work out the car situation as soon as we can. Keep on looking. Have your brakes fixed. It looks as if the Crown will buy us each a car. It looks awful good. Kiss Margie.

It was later than usual getting in but it sure helped make a dull day a lot brighter. I sat here all day and read the papers, the Life of Napoleon by Hilaire Belloc and a comparison of Lee, Grant and Sherman by Col Burne , an Englishman. I was trying to get a line on the Battles of Austirlitz [Austerlitz] and Chancellorsville as maneuvers. They are two of the worlds greatest and had exactly the same result for the Commanders.\nHope you got to see Vic and give him that package. I need it.\nLet the clippings come. I never,get to read all the papers and when I do it isn't a thorough job. The one you sent yesterday from the Post putting Hoover, Clark, Vandenberg in bed with Fritz, Kuhn, Father Coughlin and Borah was dandy. Dorothy Thompson is sure pouring it on them and how they hate her. She has an article in the Post this morning that simply tears 'em apart. I'm hoping we can get the job done as it should be and quickly. But I know we can't. Clark has dodged me ever since we came back.\nHope the kids had a good time at the game. Wish you were here of course but I rather think Marg ought to have some public school background in her home town. Sorry I missed you last night. May call from St. Louis tonight. Kiss Margie. Love to you.\nHarry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 23 SEP 25 630PM 1939\" ; 2 stamps each 3 cents United States Postage]\n       [handwritten; twice underlined]  Air Mail \n Mrs. Harry S.

[/letterhead]                             \nWashington D.C.  Oct 2, 1939.\n\nDear Bess:-  This has been a hectic day. In the first place, after sleeping from 2 to five P.M. yesterday I got up and went over to the Union Station, bought a Star and a Post (Washington variety) and then went over to the Continental Drug Store and had a bacon and tomato sandwich, came back to the office listened to the N.B.C. orchestra and the Ford Hour and then went to bed. Over slept--if the negro maid hadn't opened my door and slammed it I'd probably be there yet. It was 8:30 when I got over here & I've been hurrying ever since to catch up.\nYour letter with the clippings came while I was in the Senate. Was most happy to find it here when I came over. I usually write you a letter at 9:30 every morning but its 9:30 P.M. now. John Snyder just,left here; we had dinner at the Carroll Arms. Bob Reynolds, Hatch, Donahey, Taft, Johnson (Colo) Andrews, Tom Stewart and Lodge were all in the dining room at one time or another while we ate. I was late getting over to the office because I happened into a conference in Halsey's office where Jim Byrnes, Minton, Scott Lucas, Burke and Tom Conley were talking strategy for tomorrow's show. Pittman and Borah held forth today. Connally is the hero tomorrow and then Vandenberg. Connally told us to ask him questions if he forgot anything. Burke said he'd not do it for he remembered asking Tom one when Black was for confirmation . He was going to ask Connally why he'd voted against Hughes for confirmation and was now for Black. But he started his question by saying, \"Am I right\" - hesitated for effect, and old Tom said, \"Well if you are, it is the first time in my recollection.\" And the rest of Burke's question faded out. Tom said Burke wanted to do him like the negro did a little fish he'd caught. He said the fish just kept jumping around,[letterhead]                                  \nHarry S. Truman    Missouri   \nUnited States Senate Washington, D. C.  [/letterhead]    \n\nin the negro's hand and finally \"the nigger said, 'Hole still little fish. I just wants to gut you.'\" Tom said that was all Burke wanted to do to him.\n It was the most solemn and attentive Senate I've seen since I've been here. Both Pittman and Borah made great speeches. I'm looking for a masterpiece from Connolly. Jim Byrnes said we'd be done in three weeks. Hope he's correct. That will give me one month at home anyway. He said if our side didn't talk too much we had 65 votes and that ought to be plenty. My guess is 53 to 25 and 18 not voting.\n I'm glad it had cooled off there. It is cold here today. The heat was turned on and it has been raining most of the day. I didn't get to talk any politics at St. Louis, but there must have been many Democrats there.,You tell Aunt Ella that her Aunt's grandson came down from Savannah to see that I got a square deal. I'm mighty glad the clippings came. The one by Mr. White is particularly enlightening. Maybe he's right so I won't answer. The ones about Stark are good too.\n Hope David's cold is not serious. Just had someone try to call me collect from Waco, Texas. I refused the call. Probably some drunk trying to get out of jail.\nI'm glad the Bundschu's enjoyed themselves. Do you suppose Natalie Jackson could do Mrs. Wherritt's job if they fire the old lady?\n\nKiss Margie, love to you, Harry\nI'll send this air mail so it'll be on time. It's raining so I can't go to the Post Office.  Here are a couple of bills your P.M. sent me.

I asked Senator Burke what he thought I ought to do about the Moral Rearmament trip and he said I ought to go and make the speech, but I haven't made up my mind on it. It would be a rather strenuous air trip both ways and would in all probability be looked upon as a publicity stunt.\nI am sorry I didn't get to Ft. Riley. The St. Louis end of the trip was the Railroad meeting Wheeler and I were supposed to attend on the 13th but which was called off. Snyder called me at Chattanooga and was as nearly disgusted with me as he ever gets because I decided not to go to Ft. Riley. I got,a note from Skinkers today saying that we'd over paid 'em and that was something good. I guess I'll have to go out there and work it out. I don't understand why you haven't had a letter every day because I haven't missed. There was no note in the envelope containing the Nachman invitation. It was a nice note from the Phillips bride. Glad you went to that.\n I think I'll take advantage of your suggestion to take a short rest when Congress adjourns. I've never worked any harder at any session.\nHope you got the blankets put away and that you are finally unpacked. Here is a card that entitles you to get money from a loan shark. You evidently are rated along with Mrs. Garner for credit. I saw that article in the Post for July 13 which said that Clark is on the gridle [sic] and ended by saying I might not run. Well we'll see. \nGlad you sent it.

When I put on my clean shirt and the same gray silk suit I had at home, Mildred remarked that I looked fresh as a daisy-and I felt the way. I wasn't tired or worn out at all. I had the most peculiar tire trouble. The wheel split for about three inches and cut the tube in such a way that the tire went flat. I heard it squeaking at Richmond Ind. and got out and took the wheel wrench and tightened it up. At Springfield just in front of a tire shop and filling station the air all went out of the tire and I had to put on the spare. I am going up to Hagerstown Friday and see if that fellow won't give me a new wheel.,They called the vote in the Senate at ten minutes to five instead of five o'clock. I was changing my shirt and shoes and suit and couldn't arrive in time to vote. It rained on me from Washington, Pa. to Braddock Heights, Md., and slowed me up so that I arrived at 4:45 instead of 3:45 as I intended. I left Springfield at 5:15 A.M. which would have put me in, easily. Had breakfast at Norfolk, Ohio, half way between Zanesville and Cambridge; and lunch this side of Cumberland where the sign says \"Buttermilk and Ginger Bread.\" The Buttermilk was good and so was the Gingerbread.\nWent over to Biffle's office after the,[letterhead]                                                                                        \n Harry S. Truman                              \n Independence, Mo. [/letterhead]\n\nSenate quit and had a drink with Senators Wagner, Herring, and Ellender. Wagner said some nice things and Herring said he intended to campaign all the Iowa border counties of Missouri. There are a number of letters from all over the state giving the governor a real dressing down. One calls him Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde-for T.J.P. to get elected and against him to get headlines.\nHerring said the President was very emphatic to him in an interview, after the one with Barkley, in wanting me to be reelected, said that Roosevelt thought the governor \"an egotistical fool.\" Wish I could publish that!\n I wasn't going to call you but I had to do it. It's hell when you have only,one sweetie. But if hell's like that, I want to go there. The girls were very much pleased when I let them talk.\n Hope you get a change of weather. Biffle thinks I made a good move by trying to get in to vote. It was too close for comfort. Mr. Clark voted \"no\" as usual. Pat Harrison voted \"yes.\" He told me the other day that he'd come to Mo. [underlined] in the primary [/underlined] if I wanted him and that isn't done. I'm going to lick that double-crossing, lying governor if I can keep my health. If I do then I can really do something here for Missouri. I know I could if Old Jack or Wheeler should happen to be the fair-haired boy.\nTell my baby (big, sweet girl if she likes it better) that her dad wants to hear from her as well as her mamma.\nLove to you, Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C.

If I don't someone else will be sorry. Judge Goodrich was in to see me today as was Sam Wear. Both of them were full of advice to me and neither of them seemed to think that I had much to worry about.\nThe Pres. told Smathers he'd do something to take the Gov. off my back and old Swanson died today. Understand that Stark has refused the appointment before it is offered. I had expected to tell Mr. R. that I didn't want the gentleman taken out of my,way because then someone might run who could beat me.\nHad lunch today with Mr. Farley, Mr. Murphy, Jesse Jones, Stewart McDonald, Sen. George, Biffle and Mr. Clark. It was Clarks luncheon on a Labradore [sic] Salmon Stewart McDonald gave him. Had a very pleasant time and talked a lot of politics. The V.P. was there too. The fish was the same color and tasted just as it does out of a can. Old man Green asked me to have lunch with him and Gen. Trujillo of Santo Domingo and several others. I was glad I had the other date for the gentleman and the Ambassador may have been black. I didn't see 'em so I don't know.\nWhere's that letter my good looking young lady daughter was to send me?

It is worse here. The humidity was terrific yesterday and this air cooled system in the office makes the street and hotel like going into ovens.\nIf I was the millionaire I should be I'd send you and Margaret to Wisconsin. You can go anyway if you will say the word - to Madison or Superior. What do you say?\nGo ahead and say what the President told me about Stark. It won't hurt anything. They are about alike.\nI'm glad Margaret is all right. I was very uneasy about her and you,too when I got no letters at all from you. I started to Appomatox [sic] Court House Saturday but was so tired I didn't make it. Stopped at Spotsylvania Court House on the way back and look over the battle of the Wilderness. That's where old Longstreet got shot. He was too tough to die though.\nSpent yesterday afternoon in bed and then got up and unpacked and repacked my clothes. Put all the woolen ones in cedar bags and hung out the whites. They are not much wrinkled. Guess I'll wear an old white linen today to Swanson's funeral. The New Orleans one with a black tie. It won't be so hot as tails anyway. Hope you won't take so long to write and if you want to go north for a month or two I'll manage it.

But I did get a letter today which was most happily received. If you knew how I look forward to getting those epistles you'd never miss a day. I took your advice and went to see \"Good bye Mr. Chips.\" It was well worth seeing. I almost cried over it. I've been fool enough to believe that things are really like that and for some reason I still believe it in spite of O'Malley, Stark and McElroy. I never told you about it but I went out to see the old man (McElroy). He was too sick to be seen but Mary and Young Henry both wept over the fact that I'd called so I was repaid for going.,Mrs. Swanson almost broke up the funeral. Said she didn't want Harry Byrd on the committee. Of course Old Man Glass, as the Virginia senior, was given the right to appoint the Senate committee and naturally he wouldn't leave Byrd out. Old Garner told Barkley to tell her that we were all tired using the Senate Chamber for a funeral home and if she didn't like the way we did things, it would be called off. Well it wasn't called off. I want no state funeral. Please remember that.\nHope you didn't catch cold on that porch sleep on the first cool night. I won't be in St. Louis. Looks like I can't get away at all. We may adjourn now in two weeks after today's neutrality action.

Took us just an hour and 40 minutes to go 300 miles and the sun was shining beautifully when we passed Dallas. We are on our way back there now.\n\nThe most wonderful thing about Ft Sill was two letters from you -- and one from Margie and Mary and mamma.  The office sent your air mail letter to Washington so I recieved it at the Ft.  We are learning a lot about the needs of national defense.  The Commandant of the Post took me to his house for the night. Had Johnny Uncles over to see me and then took us to,dinner at the officers club. He is Col McIntire, one of the great field artillerymen of the army. We inspected the school and this morning went to the firing point and watched the student officer fire. Gen. Breese the VIII corps area Commander met us here. He is a friend of mine who formerly commanded Leavenworth Ordered them to give a problem and I surprised him and fired it. These Senators and Representatives stood around open mouthed and hoped I'd fall down on it -- but for some reason it came out 100% and I'm on top as a F.A. commander. Minton said they paid no attention to what I said but fired it right anyway. (I ran out of ink. In fact some of it is in my pocket due to elevation) Capt Henninger who was my executive officer in the reserve is now here. He was delighted to see me. Hope you saw Dewey & Mrs Short. Mrs. Randalls report is encouraging. Will mail this at Dallas. Love to you   Harry.,[handwritten; double underlined] Air Mail                     [circular postmark, stamp: \"FORT SILL OKLA.

We are nearing adjournment and I was afraid to leave. Succeeded in getting another one of my rail bills through the Senate yesterday so you see I haven't been idle. It was the bridge bill and one they badly wanted.\nHope Margey didn't hurt herself badly when she fell down those steps. She can't be a singing stage star if she keeps on bruising those knees.\nWilliams would make a good Senator and I've always had him in mind to succeed Clark when Clark runs for President. He wouldn't be a bad candidate for Gov. either. He's not geographically situated to run against me successfully,any more than Stark is. He'd be much harder to beat than Stark however.\nGuffey, Minton and I with Biffle polled the Senate for Barkley on neutrality and it came out 52 against 33 for and 9 doubtful with 2 away for the session. You should have seen his lip go down. He is a good fellow but he just doesn't know what goes on. He should have known that long ago and should also have known what was going on in that committee. Old Joe Robinson would have known and he'd have let some of the birds know that they'd get a punch in the nose if they lied to him too. We'll adjourn now in a week or two.

Oct. 4, 1939.\n\nDear Bess:-  Your letter came just now and I am glad the special finally got there. I have to go to old man Logan's funeral - Barkley made a special request. I'm going over to Caruthersville and make a neutrality speech Sunday, so I'll have lots of letters when I get back here. Will call you from Memphis and from Caruthersville so we won't be out of touch. Barkley, Halsey, et al. think I should take advantage of the free ride to the funeral to help the situation on earth here, so I'm going to do it.\nGlad you don't feel too badly about Oscar. He's a lovable kid and I'm always sympathetic to the weak boys. Might have been one myself under certain conditions. But along lines like that I'm rather,like my mamma, and she has no weaknesses except to talk too frankly.\nI'm pleased at the car deal. You will get the radio yet. The Chrysler, I think, is a better buy. We're learning how to deal at last. There's a hundred dollars we'd never have had if we'd jumped at the first offer. Whenever you think they've reached the end of their deal, take the car home and I'll fix it up when I get there. They told me that any deal I made would be either cash or credit.\nIt look as if the Crown deal would pay for both trades if we make 'em. Mr. Clark is all the way in my band wagon. He's been almost on the edge of kissing me for two days. Got mad at the Gov. while he was here. I asked Mr. Shoop why he treated the Gov. so mean on his F.B.I. speech. Said he wouldn't have noticed him at all if he could have helped it.\nKiss Margie, love to you, Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 6 OCT 4 8-PM 1939\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\n Mrs. Harry S.

I waited until ten o'clock mail to be sure Margaret's came all right and that helped quite a lot. Too bad about Bob's wife. I sent him a wire. Forgot to mention it when I called up.\nHave been going to bed at nine o'clock and getting up at six for a whole week now and am feeling fine except that at night I am always mighty tired. More people have been in to see me lately and they all seem to have impossible problems. Mrs. Roby is very anxious to get Bill into the Naval Academy.,She called me and told me all about it and I told her the only way Bill could get an appointment was through the competitive exam held for the District. I can't appoint anyone outside Missouri unless he can establish a residence there. She wasn't sure whether she wanted to spend the thousand dollars on the preparation or not. Al Holland is still out of luck too and hunting for a job. He called me at 6:45 this morning and wanted to come down and talk to me about it, and I let him come. I wonder what these people did for a father confessor before I came? It must be something in my face I guess. My own family use me for the same purpose and so do all the political boys. But I never do 'em much good-only with sympathy and maybe that's what they want.\nKiss Margey, love to you, Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 17 JUL 20 6-PM 1939\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

I suppose Joe McGee just wants someone to rehash his troubles with. They are investigating what they term the insurance racket. McGees have had a monopoly on the City and County business for thirteen years, so he may be worried. I'm rather glad I'm poor, except for the inconvenience to my wife and daughter.\nBrice Smith called me yesterday and asked me to go down to the War Dept. and get him an army engineer for director of Public Works. Johnson is in Calif. and Woodring is a K.C. Star man and it wouldn't do to talk to the Pres about it. I guess I'm going to have to talk to Woodring. Personally, I think it's a good idea.,Went out to dinner last night with Jim Nugent and Henry Depping and some lawyer for the Rock Island R.R. from Chicago and his girl. She came from No'th Ca'lina and it took her ten minutes to say it. Depping is a Republican and one of the inner circle in K.C. He told me he'd try to get enough Republican candidates into the Senatorial race so they wouldn't vote in my primary. That'll help. Mr. Ted Alford called me and told me that he'd been informed by his paper that I could beat Stark. Somewhat of an admission I'd say.\nWheeler and I have been in a conference on the Chandler Bill. That's the one for the B. & O. R.R. Have to meet this morning and this afternoon.\nSure too bad about Bob Wells. Hope he takes it standing up and I think he will.\nKiss Margey. Love to you.

I'm on the Frisco ready to pull out - have my train ticket and my plane ticket in my pocket. It is a good thing. I went out walking yesterday afternoon after taking a nap. I'd bought my tickets in the morning.\n Left my wallet in my blue suit pocket, hanging in the closet - and someone came in while I was gone out and rifled it. Whoever it was got $33. Had I not paid for my tickets I guess I'd been out that too. I think the hotel will stand for it. Only had $4 in my pocket, and that will have to run me until I can get to Caruthersville. I'm so happy I'd paid out,$45 for a plane ticket and $20 for my railroad ticket in the morning. I'll get the plane cost back when I get to Washington. Even if the hotel doesn't come across, I'm ahead anyway.\nIt's the first time it ever happened to me and there have been times when it would have been two or three hundred dollars. I just didn't take all the things out of my coat pockets because I expected to wear this suit today. I'd had on my very dark gray for Logan's funeral. Well anyway it's something. I nearly fell over when I went to pay the hotel bill and the wallet was empty. It gives you a sinking sort of feeling.

Went down to Charlottesville and stayed all night to get out of reach of all the drunken Missourians in town. I'm trying to keep from eating and drinking much while we're really working so hard and I have to hide to do it!\nYou should not have missed a day on letters. I've mailed you one every morning at seven thirty and haven't missed a [day] since I got back except right at the first and then I called you up. Maybe somebody is investigating the corespondence [sic]. I'm glad Aunt Ella is well and I hope she lives to be a hundred. I'll look,forward to seeing the Times for Friday. But I bet it's something mean. Saw Willie's suggestion about the assessment. Glad you read the Moral Rearmament. That makes it legal. Glad the records came all right. We worked and fought and cussed over old man Willard's bill in Wheeler's office Saturday until 4 o'clock. Then I came over here and just pulled up and left. Slept until 1:30 today and then came back. Vic and Mrs. Vic were sitting in the office trying to decide where to go eat. I had eaten about 3 P.M. at a little place called Bowling Green. They gave me soup, steak, two vegetables, head lettuce, ice tea and cantloupe [sic] a la mode for 65 cents, and it was good. If I hadn't had dinner the Vics were going to take me with 'em. They went to the Allies Inn. They wanted to be remembered. Hope it stays cool there - it's warmer here today. I've been wearing a vest.

Paul Nachtman came in this morning from the B. & O. train and we had breakfast together. He ate a farm hand's breakfast. Said he quit smoking and had gained forty pounds. Maybe that's the reason the present-day gals pay so much tribute to George Washington Hill of the American Tobacco Company. They are trying to keep thin. Paul bought me a St. Louis Globe Democrat in which was an article by Harve Duvall, their able political writer stating that Stark had grabbed credit that really belongs to Milligan, that Milligan would make a better candidate than Stark for Senator etc. Well he would.,I don't want Milligan to run unless he and Stark run together. That would be too good.\nWell you had a change of heart, didn't you? The letter came. Millie came running in with it and said she hoped she could keep her job another day. I always threaten to fire 'em all if I don't get a letter. She'll write you about the Pepper Bill. It probably won't pass at this session. We are now trying to adjourn on the second. Barkley wants to get home to vote in the Kentucky primary on the fifth. They are nominating a governor this time.\nPerry hasn't come back and there's no prospect that he will soon. Understand he calls Mrs. R. regularly and if he doesn't she does. How's that? I guess my last letter to Uncle Willie scraped his conscience. Will read the Friday editorial. The Star editorial on Canfil was to keep him from being appointed. They haven't sent Henry's name down yet.

Oct. 9, 1939.\n\nDear Bess:-  Well I arrived on time. Had a Pullman berth on the plane. It was more comfortable after I became accustomed to the engine noise. I dreamed the plane fell, but it didn't as you can see. There were 20,100 paid admissions to the fair Sunday afternoon, and I shook hands with at least a third of 'em. Gave away another prize and crowned a jittery race horse with a floral horseshoe before a grandstand full of people. My speech went over big apparently. At least a hundred people remarked about it.\nThe preacher's dinner was a dandy. He preached a good sermon, invited me into the church office, and nearly all the congregation came in to see me. Old Judge McCarthy was along with me and he,seemed to have a grand time too. The preacher's two sons and their wives were there [inserted] for dinner [/inserted] - two grand young men - and Mrs. Foster's [scratched out] mother was also present. One of the boys had a four-year-old daughter who was almost as pretty and cute as our baby used to be at that age. Reverend Foster is the most influential preacher in southeast Missouri and he spent the whole time getting all the facts on Pendergast and Stark. I made lots of hay I'll tell you. But it was hard work. They nearly pulled me to pieces. The Memphis crowd finally rescued me, and we had dinner in the Peabody Hotel at 10:00 P.M. Rather stylish hour, what?\nThere were four lovely letters - three from you, one from Margaret. Nice note of Mary McElroy's. I'll thank the Brazilian. Yes, the laundry came on time. I should have told you. Now I haven't missed a day writing - even on the funeral party I took time out to write. Glad you roofed the barn. Hope Frank didn't take it too hard. I don't know about writing Gates. I'd better wait and talk to him. I'd be pretty mad if someone took up my private affairs with my brother. Hope I didn't leave out answers to any questions.

Hope you and George got the driveway fixed up like it ought to be. It is entirely likely that you have some sore arms and a stiff back. Hope it didn't hurt the neck.\nSaw the Post article and one from the Globe Democrat about Stark and Milligan. We won't be so badly off when the time comes. I told the Atty. Gen. to send down Henry Dillingham's name today for the U.S. Marshall. They promised to get me another job for Fred Canfil. Maybe I can make him U.S. Marshall for Puerto Rico or Alaska or Panama.\nDick Duncan came over and talked me into accepting the situation. Said,that all Henry's friends were mine and his and if a Republican should be elected President then we'd be out a U.S. Marshall so I gave in as I always do and told 'em to send Henry's name down. Guess the Star will do a lot of crowing over it, but that's a part of the political game.\nJim Nugent and Charlie Hay were both in to see me this morning as were Henry Depping and Mary Redwood. She still is trying to land her hubby a job in Washington. I won't be home by the first because we can't possibly adjourn that soon. Tell me how much of a check you need for your mother and I'll send it right away. We got to work at eleven this morning and probably will work until nine tonight. Have a dinner date with Joe Guffey. Kiss Margey. Love to you. Harry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 12 JUL 25 6-M 1939\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

Glad the candy arrived - I was out buying it when I got robbed. I'm sure one of the bellhops got the money.\nYour teeth should be fixed at once. I have my own dentist and he's the best I know, but you don't like him. So you pick the one you think you can trust and [underlined] get the job done. [/underlined] I never did think Berry knew anything, but if you wanted him it was all right.\nHere are some bills which came direct from the P.O. in Indep. I am sending them with the checks, if they are O.K. send 'em on. The Philharmonic sent better seats this time. I am enclosing them.\nThe Messall's are getting settled. Vic says it'll take a year to get straightened up,and get all the little things fixed as they should be. Said he spent Sunday cleaning the basement and front yard.\nHope you have had a cool wave by this time. It's summer time here and was it hot in S.E. Mo? I nearly melted, but I'm sure some good was done.\nHarry Hawes called me and said that he'd heard from several sources that the governor is on the toboggan, and he was inclined to believe it. Well if a counterfeit like Mr. Stark can fool the people, they'll deserve what they get. It looks now as if Wheeler and I will be in St. Louis some time later in the month on the railroad issue. I hope I'll get home if that happens. I forgot to put Margie's check in her letter yesterday.

I told 'em that when a letter failed to appear on any day I'd fire 'em all. So - you and the P.O. had better perform 100%. Hope that you and Christy got your washing dry. Shall I send you some to add to it? Had a letter from Arcade-Sunshine wanted to know why you quit 'em. I told them that you had gone home and that I still was sending them a small amount of shirts, underwear, etc.\nWent out [to] dinner last night - the first time since you left - with Joe Guffey, Minton, Swellenback , Chavez, Connelly, Scott Lucas, Radcliff, Barkley and JoeTumulty [scratched out],made up the party. We had a grand time. It was Joe's party and was held at the Red Fox Inn out on the road to Rockville. Had highballs to start, soup, red wine, salad, filet mignon, ice cream - and champaign [sic]. It must have set Mr. Guffey back about 500 a head. We are working on the lending bill. I presided most of yesterday afternoon and this morning. It looks like Aug 5th for quitting time. Will see you probably a week after adjournment.\nShannon wants me to help him reorganize the week when we get home. If I do any reorganizing it will be on my own hook.\n Duncan has just called me from the floor and I've got to run. It's about Dillingham I guess.\nKiss Margey. Love to you.

Barkley, Minton, Ed Burke, McKellar and John Miller are the Senators. Well old Frazier is along, but only for courtesy. Austin was suppose to come, but had to have an operation on his eye and couldn't. He's by far the nicest and most able Republican. He and I have been on several subcommittees and when he tells you anything, it is just that way.\nWe are crossing Kentucky on the C&O Ry. riding on the George Washington Limited. At Louisville we take the L & Nashville to Bowling Green.,After the funeral I take it to Memphis and then the Frisco to Caruthersville. I'll have very little expense because they are going to give me a ticket from St. Louis to Washington and pay for all my meals. So my only expense will be from Bowling Green to Caruthersville and my hotel bill in Memphis. I was expecting to fly and have about a hundred and ten dollars expense, but the junior Senator from Ky helped out. Barkley made a personal matter of my coming so it all worked out.\nThe Gov is to address the SE Mo fair today and I'm to do it Sunday. I think I have a good speech in my system.

I haven't missed a single day. Wrote the Gentry lady that I would do all I could for her. Mr. Shannon hasn't mentioned her yet. Will be glad to talk with Harry Murphy. By all means go and see the McElroys. If they see you going it won't hurt. Now is when they want sympathy and I went out to see him when I was at home. He couldn't be seen but Mary and Henry were very grateful. When the old man was on top he never refused me a favor. I asked for but very few but he was always willing & now that he,is on the way out I feel more like being for him than when he was on top.\nWe'll quit sometime next week I think but it will be several days before I can leave. Was just appointed on the most important conference committee on the rail bills we'll have today. But I doubt if we do much until January. Got another most important rail bill on the calender [sic] today too. Got Republicans, Democrats, rail lawyers, Wheeler and our lawyers all to agree. It took six weeks of maneuvering. A young fellow named Taylor did all the work and I gave him credit in the record.\nWish I could have seen Ed Neill's wedding present. I know it was beautiful.\nClark said he was to see Tuck Milligan yesterday and that he'd rub a little salt on Stark. He thinks maybe we can get 'em all in the race. Kiss Margey.

Oct. 11, 1939.\n\nDear Bess:-  Was glad to get your Monday letter today and the air mail yesterday. Haven't heard from the hotel. It was so late when I finished my dinner in Memphis I failed to see them Sunday night. I wrote them a good stiff letter yesterday.\n You certainly did get a cheap book shelf. I'm sure you can get the car billed the way you want it. There wasn't any reason to be uneasy about the plane. It was clear when I started and the sun was shining when the stewardess woke me up. I was dreaming the plane was falling. It hasn't rained here yet. It's been a record heat wave, but cooler today. Was 90 in the shade yesterday.,We gave 'em a good licking on the neutrality recommitment yesterday. Vote was 65 to 26. Mr. Nye said it meant nothing but if everyone votes it will be 68 to 27 on the final. Bone can't get here. If he could that would give 'em another one. Glass and Shipstead were paired, and Smith and Wiley. Old Ship didn't announce how he would have voted - he just stated that he withheld his vote.\nJack Cochran asked me to spend the weekend fishing with him, but he's going to leave tomorrow and I'm afraid Barkley and Minton won't let me go. Saw him at the Post M's dinner last night. Mrs. Williams took me off to one side and said she was going to do everything she could for me - she wanted you to come back.

I presided from 3:30 to seven and then had dinner with Swellenbach as host and Guffey, Minton, Barkley & Burke as guests. Five of us run next year. Every one of us faces a terrific fight. Cochran the Neb. Gov. has filed against Burke already. Minton said the Republicans would probably chase him out in Indiana. Swellenbach's collegue has induced a man to file against him and Guffey has plenty of trouble in Pa. Barkley said he'd bet a hat we all came back. Hope he's right.\nI succeeded in getting a real rail bill agreed to and on the Senate callender yesterday. It regulates subsidiaries and,holding companies of railroads. It is the real reform bill that Wheeler and I have been working for in the investigation. Have held copious hearings on it as chairman of the subcommittee. Wheeler said I couldn't get it out. The railroads said they couldn't stand it, and no one thought it could be done. I got Lowenthal and Taylor, two of our young attorneys, to get the chief counsels of the Santa Fe, Pennsylvania, New York Central, and Union Pacific into a conference and the bill is on for passage. That's a real job. The Christian Science Monitor of July 26 had a grand editorial on the Wheeler-Truman Bill, and by the way that bill, amended out of all semblance to itself, passed the House day before yesterday and they passed it as the Wheeler-Truman Bill. So if we ever can agree on it, it will be our bill. We've got until the next Congress adjourns to do it. So you see I've been working.

I suppose that's why dad has had no letter this week - or have we had some more grades in the S bracket? I'll still be looking for the letter.\nIt is to be hoped we get done in another week or so. Barkley,almost got an agreement to limit debate yesterday, but Mr. Clark wouldn't agree. McNary, Borah, Vandenburg and even Nye were willing but not the Statesman from Mo. Barkley will try again today and except him from the agreement.

I overslept and didn't get up until nine o'clock. They all thought I was sick at the hotel - the bellboy, elevator boy and clerk all remarked on my getting up so late.\nIt was nice to talk with you last night but didn't last nearly long enough. Minton and I went to see Sonya Heine in some fool show about Hollywood and skates etc at the Capital. But there was a good stage show and so we didn't entirely lose an evening. Minton is a regular kid. He stopped and looked into every window and said he always wanted to buy everything he saw.\nHe and Wheeler had a set to on the floor the other day and Wheeler told him his mouth was too big. Minton,said he'd never go to one of Wheeler's committee meetings again. But I'm sure that won't happen.\nHope to see that Man in the Iron Mask. It's been twenty five years since I read the book but maybe I can remember it. You and Margey fix up your Colorado trip as you want it and I'll try to get there to take you. Do you want to drive? I've had a new tire put on and also a new wheel where that one split. Never did get one from the factory. But I may yet. Hope we can make the rodeo. Will try. John L. Lewis has certainly helped old man Garner. He just grins and grins. I believe he liked it. The Hatch Bill won't hurt me and it will force Mr. Milligan to resign if he wants to run against me.

Sorry Miss Marian was so ill treated. You tell her that if Uncle Harry had been there he'd probably have let her wipe her feet all over the place. I'm glad about Miss Margie's grades. Hope she keeps it up and I'm sure she will. Was grand for her to be elected to the honor society too.\nThe gang found me on the train and we had a very pleasant time all the way to Chicago. I had a bedroom and parlor at the Stevens, got a good rest Sunday night, had breakfast with Leo Packer, Mr. Byers and Dick Adams. Dick you know was a Republican alderman in Kansas City. He said he,is for me and expected to do all he could. The Truckers from Mo. seemed to be enthusiastically for me - and the speech seemed to go over all right.\n All three Chicago papers, however just said that \"Sen Truman of Mo. also spoke.\" They quoted at length a Kuhn Loeb banker who gave the New Deal several knocks. He was one I'd had on the pan before the R.R. committee, but he was very friendly to me and offered to buy me a drink which I refused.\nVic was at the train, it was on time to the dot and I feel fine this morning.\nKiss Margie.

[/letterhead] Oct 17, 1939\n\nDear Bess:-  Glad the special got in on time. I was most happy to get your Sunday letter. I took Frank Lee, his wife and an old man from Cassville and his wife to dinner last night down at Hogates. Vic was along and insisted on paying half the bill. Frank is still over at the office. He talks to me so much that I can't answer any mail or even write to you,so I came over to the Senate. Old Walsh is speaking. Minton calls him the Pope of the Senate. In my opinion he is the most insincere man, excepting always the Hon. Robt. R. Reynolds of No'th Ca'lina, in the Senate.\nYou asked about Perry and the stamps. He knows we use about ten dollars worth a month so he just made a contribution to the cause. Had Ben bring 'em up.,Sorry you had bad luck with your curtains, but I've an idea you needed some new ones anyway.\n The House hasn't been at work and I guess that is [the] reason Bell's at home. Too bad about the saddle horse. I spent most of Sunday in the office and went to bed very early. Work doesn't mean much to Bell anyway.\n It was a pleasure to hear that Margie's cold is gone.,Nearly everyone in the Senate has had one.\nThe Gov. of La. stopped in to see me Sunday - the Ex Gov that's indicted. Ellender told me today that he told him that I'd treated him fine.\nWish I could come home. Barkley says now Nov. 1st.\nKiss Margie.

Ralph is at Baltimore for the National Guard Association meeting. Clark has recommended him for W.P.A. director to take Murray's place. But I'm of the opinion he won't get the job. As I told you yesterday, I think I have Harry Easley lined up for the job. Looks like everybody got rich in Jackson County but me. I'm glad I can still sleep well even if it is a hardship,on you and Margie for me to be so damn poor. Mr. Murray, Mr. McElroy, Mr. Higgins, and even Mr. P. himself probably would pay all the ill-gotten loot they took for my position and clear conscience. What think you?\nI disgraced you last night. Minton, Hatch, and I went to the Gaiety. It was a most rotten show, but there were a couple of vaudeville acts that were worth seeing. We met a couple of,Congressmen, one from Indiana one from Ohio, with their wives going in. The ladies seemed to be as embarrassed as we were - and they should have been.\nI've had an avalanche of Missourians today who wanted in the gallery. They all got in.\nHad lunch with Eddie Cantor, the Vice President, Barkley, and a dozen of the elect today. Eddie's a grandpa and Barkley told a Kentucky story - an old fellow who said he didn't mind being a grandpa but he hated to be married to grandma. Kiss Margie. Get your teeth fixed.

Well, if he wants to become a Catholic I have no objection, of course. Now don't pass the buck to me on the wedding present - you know more about what is correct than I ever will. I'm very fond of those nephews. You ought to appreciate how I feel toward them by your own feeling for Fred's children. You put the amount into the present that you'd want to put into it for your own nephew. Get 'em something they can use and can't break up.\nHere's another one, too, who'll have to have a present. She's a tough egg, but Lester Jordon would cut a throat for me and we'll have to come across with something. Five dollars is enough for this one.,This is her second venture. The first one resulted in a cross-eyed son, so cross-eyed it makes your head ache to look at him. Just as bad as the crazy movie actor, Roscoe Ates, or whatever his name is.\nHope you got your hat all right and that the bridge game was a success.\nWent to see Mr. Smith Goes to Washington last night with Minton. Sat in a box with J. Monroe Johnson and Mrs. Johnson, with Louis Johnson next to us in another box. Jim Farley, old man Norris, Wheeler, Guffey and a lot of other Senators were present. It makes asses out of all Senators who are not crooks. But it also shows up the correspondents in their true drunken light too.

Of course we always have to take care of our own. How many kicks did Christie give you before you got the letter? You know of course by this time how the Senate behaved Friday.\nThe Senior Senator from New Mexico asked me to go to dinner with him last night. I went and met a couple of ancient dowagers from New Mexico, but had a very pleasant dinner at the Russian Troyka. The music was excellent and loud so I didn't have to say much. Got in about midnight,and slept until ten this morning. Have slept most of the day since. Got out at 5 P.M. and walked uptown. Stopped at the Columbia and saw the \"Man in the Iron Mask.\" It's a good show. Had started up to see Eddie Cantor. He'll have to wait. It is eight thirty now and I am going to bed again when I have finished this letter. It'll have to go air mail if you get it on time.\n I'm going to spend tomorrow getting my N.Y. speeches ready. Hatch, Minton and I may go to the races if the weather is as pretty as it is today. Hope my world broadcast went over. I had no way of knowing whether it did or not.

You should have one from me today too. I was most happy to get to talk last night--and I dreamed about you all night--just kept reaching for you and you weren't there. When I awoke about 5:30 I thought I was home. Glad you thought well of the candy. Since I couldn't write Thursday and Friday thought I'd better send something to square things.\nI am to see the President Wednesday if things work out as they should. Then that plane leaves on Thursday at 8:00 A.M. from Bolling Field. I am enclosing you the itinerary. If I go, I'll write or wire you every day from,wherever we are. Since Minton and Swartz are going I thought I might be better off making this inspection of national defense than to be there taking it on the chin with the Long trial, Mr. Higgins, and Mr. Murray. At least they can get no interviews from me. We will have to consider a $2 billion defense bill, and maybe I'd know more about it.\n Now all the above is an alibi to justify my really wanting to go - and the only qualm of conscience I have, and it is a bad one, is that it is by myself and not with you and the daughter. Maybe you won't feel too badly about it because I've never taken a pleasure trip since I can remember without you. I just think I'll go though. It won't cost a penny and will not add to the government cost. What do you really think?

I'd be in the paid lobbyist class if I took pay to get my bills approved, so I only took railroad fare.\n The meeting in Rochester was a grand one. They seemed to believe what I told them and I'm sure I did some good. We then went to a little town of LeRoy where the big banker of the town had organized the Rochester meeting gave us something for a cough and then we went to Batavia where I made the speech all over again to a bunch of small town bankers. This was all in Cong. Wadsworth home district. He'd been in St Louis and refered to the R.R. bill as that vicious Wheeler-Truman Bill\" I rather think I built a fire under,him without saying a word about him. At least I proved that the bill is anything but vicious. We got on the N.Y.C. and went to New York City that night, and at noon I spoke to all the big bankers you read about in the papers. Kuhn Loeb, Morgan-Stanley, Brown Bros. and Harriman, and a lot of others. Some of 'em I'd panned in good fashion before the R.R. Committee. They were most courteous to me however. Last night I had dinner at the University Club with Pierpont Davis and a lot of millionaires. There were thirteen at the table. One had been Pres. of the American Bankers Assn. last year, and the rest were just like him. They were trying to impress the country boy I guess, but the country banker told me as we went to the train that the sale had been the other way. He was pleased because I'd told them some things that they should know about financial statesmanship and public ethics. They asked for it & I spoke from the shoulder.

Two tuxedos (white and black) two wool suits and three white ones. Harry, Vic and Fred came in after you called or after I called and so did Minton's Secretary. We had a pleasant evening and went to bed at 9:30. Up at 5:30 this morning. Vic came by at seven we had breakfast and went to Bolling Field. Sen. Thomas and I were first to arrive. Then Swartz and Gurney. Some of the Congressmen were late. One never did show up or call up.\n We left at 8:35 (supposed to leave at 8) and are now over the Skyline Drive. The mountains are covered with snow and the trees are a beautiful color. The day is bright and beautifully clear.,A most propitious start and I am sure we'll have a grand time. Mrs. Swartz came to the plane with the Sen and said she had to argue with herself for two nights before she'd let him go. She came to the same conclusion you did that the ride this way is as safe as forty on Wyoming roads covered with ice.\nThe girls went to the Soviet Party on my ticket and had the time of their lives. Reathal wouldn't go. She was afraid they'd throw her out. I call Catherine and Mildred a couple of reds. Mildred is coming home Nov. 15th. Said she and Margie would be eating Sundaes very soon.

Minton and I went to a picture show, which,I told you about. We went to the ball game yesterday on a couple of free tickets he had, and Washington won five to two. They've been constant losers. I went up to the Metropolitan by myself and saw Man about Town. It is a very funny show. The nigger steals the screen.\n I usually read myself to sleep every night. Have found another book on the Civil War, by Colonel A. H. Burne, an Englishman. He makes a comparison of the leadership of Lee, Grant, and Sherman in the last year of the war. Looks like he's going to rate them in that order.\nHaven't talked with Bennett since he saw Milligan. Things aren't in [inserted] as [/inserted] bad shape as they were however and I am sure they'll get better before next year. Hope we get done this week. Harry\nKiss Margey, love to you, \nHope you had good luck with  your painting.

It was light entertainment for the galleries - almost as good as burlesque. I am to go to Rochester, New York, Wednesday night for a speech on the R.R. bill at the request of the Rochester Chamber of Commerce and on Friday at New York City. The railroads are sponsoring the meetings I suppose. If I could just get the waterway fellows to take me on now, there could be no accusation of partiality - but they won't. They are against the bill.\nI won [scratched out] $2.50 [/scratched out] $1.50 on the number of votes cast against the bill last night. We,made up a pot, each putting in $1.00. There were about thirty in it. I guessed twenty-nine, and Minton guessed thirty. We agreed to split if either won. Minton got $5.00 out of the pot and I got half of it, so I didn't lose my dollar.\n I'm glad the new bus is doing so well. I put fifteen gallons in the tank to begin with. Hope it is making twenty miles. That will be too good I fear. Hope you and Miss Margie didn't get your heads burned.\nIt would be most thoughtful, I believe, for you to send the First Lady a corsage. I'm not going to be able to get there, and if you don't want to go don't do it. If I remember correctly when I flew home to introduce her, she didn't even say thank you. You do as you please.  Kiss Margie, love to you\n Harry.\nHas my daughter a sore finger or has she forgotten what a pen is for?

Sill was really better than I told you because I didn't want to brag. When old man McIntyre said the solution was perfect and helped me knock down the ears of Gen Breese who started to tell me what I should have done it had to be good. It was on the same range and from the same firing point from which I fired my first problem under Col. Danford. So I was doing some sentimental thinking. The school detail made up of Natl. Guard and Reserve Officers were somewhat surprised as were the school officers to see a Senator fire a battery. Major Wilson, who is an artilleryman told me tonight that none of them including himself supposed I'd have nerve enough to try it. So much for the bragging.\n\nWe came over the most beautiful country today I've ever seen - mountains as they look in paintings by old masters - valleys in cultivation with here and there a beautiful home.

This hotel is the best one we've been in and I include Louisville and Shreveport. The water is good and they have some hot from a faucet; the food excellent and the people most intelligent. It is cool enough for a wool suit and vest and I am sleeping under a blanket.\n\nThey say we'll roast tomorrow in Panama.

Good thing you sent the insurance notice. It expires on Oct. 23. I'll mail it direct. Make 'em reciept [sic] the bills. I keep a file on them so if the income tax man ever wants to look me up he won't have anything to quarrel about.\nI am supposed to go [to] Aberdeen today to witness some ordinance tests. It all depends on whether the Senate expects to take action. Mr. Clark made his contribution yesterday and the most difficult things about it was keeping a quorum. On one occasion they had to call the roll three times.\nMrs. Clark and Mrs. Thompson were,in the gallery and came up the same elevator I did in the office building. Mrs. Clark wanted to know if you were here and asked very cordially about you. She seemed to think that Bennett had read a historic document. The rest of us thought it was just another page in the record, and a nail, perhaps in his polical [sic] coffin - especially if he still has the Presidential Bee in his bonnet. I guess it all depends on the point of view and your association with the speaker.\nI'm certainly sorry to hear of Fred's mishap. I hope it's not as serious as you think. I've also worried about a job for him. If they hadn't mixed up the Federal Housing situation I could have placed him there, but it looks now like they might fire most of my people including Vivian.

If they don't come soon, we'll go off and leave them.\n\nThis place is as you'd expect it. The most beautiful setting in a valley completely surrounded by mountains. The city has a no tall buildings, because of earthquakes - which come about every twenty years. The last bad one was in 1917. There is a beautiful cathedral and has some lovely homes, but the city itself is not beautiful to see - too much poverty, although there are no beggars. Veracruz was full of 'em.\n\nThe President gave us a reception yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock and,the American minister had one at six-thirty. It was a grand affair. They had the police band and all the trimmings. It was informal dress however.\n\nThe American Consulate or whatever you call the place a minister lives in, is magnificent. So was El Presidente's house.\n\nThe hotels have lobbies like palaces with tile floors, plants, etc. poinsettias by the hundreds and hibiscus and other red flowers. Gurney says the hedge is hibiscus and some other long word is the other pink flower. We just took off, left one Congressman, and my pen ran out of ink. We are up seven thousand feet now and headed for San Jos?, Costa Rica, where we'll do it all over again tonight and then go to Panama. Had a cable from Vic that Marvin Casteel was made W.P.A. director. Well it could be worse. He voted for me in 1934 when Clark told him not to.

No one appreciates eyes as I do. Mine have been a handicap for fifty years.\nGlad that Arnie was in a good frame of mind. They ought not to hold the situation against us because I've really saved Oscar four different times. Stuart McDonald is leaving and I suppose my pull will be gone with him. He's getting a $75000.00 a year job with the Maryland Causualty [sic] Co., so it is rumored. I'd be tempted to quit myself under such circumstances.\n I went over to Aberdeen yesterday after all. It was a grand demonstration.,I came to the conclusion that anti-air artillery is not enough against a plane attack in force. We must also have plenty of planes for defense as well. That's a real admission from an artilleryman, and that was not the intention of the demonstration either.\nBrought Dewey Short back with me and he told me an earful about the Republican estimate of Stark. It is far from high. He also told me that my position had improved exceedingly in the last three months. I'm sure he wouldn't be telling me what I wanted to hear.\nI'll go look at that car. I'm satisfied with it if you are. The color is good too. Why don't you get some new curtains if you want them?

The boys have been separating my propaganda mail. Harry Salisbury, Joe Gilfoyle, Fred Whitaker, George Charno and even Katherine came down today to finish the job. There are at least twenty thousand letters, ten thousand post cards and a number of petitions. One petition has 10000 names on it. We are trying to decide whether we should answer any of them or not. I am of the opinion we ought to acknowledge all of them.\nJoe Guffey and I went to Laurel Md. yesterday afternoon to the races. I had a grand time. Saw Mr. Bruce who wants to succeed Geo Radcliff, Geo Allen the,district commissioner and a lot of other people and had a grand time. I bet on about six of the eight races and won $2000. If I had been satisfied and bet on all but the last two races I'd have had about ten dollars more, but you can't account for things like that.\nI received a book from Marquis James on V.P.

Everything has been going as fine as can be since the fire at Montgomery field. In fact the army has had the jitters ever since, and I suppose it's just as well. We have had extra care in every way possible. They gave us packs at Ft. Sill with a 45, a machete, emergency rations, and a parachute for use over the Central American and Mexican jungles. Hope we won't need 'em. The weather is fine, the wind behind us, and the Gulf is visible on the left, Mexico on the right. Looks just like Texas.\n\nMinton and I sent Cactus Jack a telegram last night to tell him that McNutt seemed to be sweeping Texas,he'd better call out the shock troops. Sent him another this morning telling him that after a trip to Matamoras (I can't spell it) it looked as if McNutt would carry Mexico too.\n\nHe'll probably have a smart reply for us when we get back to San Antonio next week. We now have six passengers in our plane. Gurney of So. Dakota, Minton, Cong. Shafer of Mich, Cong. Byron of Md and a regular army Colonel on leave going to Panama. Haven't learned his name yet and it is very difficult to talk on the plane. You have to yell for all you're worth and conversation is not at a premium until the sun is over the yard area. Then there is plenty of talk.\n\nChamber of Com at Brownsville gave us a dinner in that Mexican town last night. Venison, duck and quail with all the Mexican trimmings. At that I was in bed at 10:30.\n\nHope I can mail this at Vera cruz.\n\nLove to you, Harry"

Rufus Burrus, his wife & son were here and Rufus said he knew whose hand writing was on that letter. He'd seen too many of them come to camp. They will be here until Thursday. I am taking them to lunch today. Mrs. B. was particularly anxious to see the St. Gauden's Grief. Said wouldn't dare face Miss Brown if she came here and didn't see it.\nI was much surprised at J. C.'s announcement. It doesn't seem possible. He was a twin and an ordinary pocket handkerchief would cover them both. We must be slowly and gradually leaving the middle-age bracket, what?,Was very glad to hear that Mamma and Mary got home safely. I have been uneasy about them ever since I heard it. Mary got her expenses paid to go, and Mamma wanted to go, so go she did. You never can tell what a change of water and diet will do to an eighty-seven-year-old and I was afraid of the road too. My family won't be seriously put out by J. C.'s Catholic in-laws. Mamma's youngest sister and our favorite aunt was a Catholic. In my opinion people's religious beliefs are their own affair, and when I don't agree with 'em I just don't discuss religion. It has caused more wars and feuds than money, and that seems a shame too.\nThat dumb car salesman ought to have his head examined. You tell him that a Senator has two legal residences.

The sergeant put it out with a little hand fire extinguisher before the post fire department got there. Don't worry about the situation, because the army is taking every precaution. They simply can't afford a serious accident on this trip.\n\nWe were royally treated at Shreveport, just as we were at Louisville and Montgomery.

I did it once before, on the way from Chicago to Washington by way of Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. That time it was dark and thunderstorms were under us.

I'm always threatening to fire them if they don't find me a letter from you in the mail. The blanket suggestion and linen from Margaret could hardly be improved upon. As I told you yesterday your judgment in those things is far above mine. Don't give 'em Community Silver, though I don't have to tell you that.\nHope the bridge ladies didn't pan your last years clothes too much.\n Rufus Burrus left yesterday and then Frank Lee pulled out and now Vic Stein is in town. He's a good Jew, however who thinks that I'm the greatest Senator,ever. He's very fond of Jim Pendergast. Said they'd been raising so much cain lately in K.C. that he had to take a trip to clear his head.\nIt is some job writing a speech for Chicago, one for the 35th Division Reunion and entertaining all these guests and trying to get thirty thousand envelopes addressed and sent.\nMr. Rush Holt entertained the Senate yesterday and Joe Guffey and I studied the various strains of thoroughbred horses at Laurel (in the interest of agriculture you understand). I lost most of my Saturday's winnings but we had a grand time and didn't have to listen to Rush.\n You'll probably have a telegram from me to meet me at the airport the day you get this.\nKiss Margie.

We are slowly and gradually approaching the end. It will come tomorrow or next,day I'm sure.\n Mr. Clark and I have had a time trying to get to the W.P.A. office to recommend a man for Murray's place. It looks as if they would really put poor old Murray in the jug. There doesn't seem to be anything I can do about it either.

Your air mail letter of yesterday arrived on time just now and I'm glad you are going to the funeral of Mize's father-in-law. I'd like to see those blankets, but of course I can't. The glasses for the Jordan girl are fine of course and she'll probably not use 'em for tea.\n I don't know what to do about the Y.M.H.A. meeting for Mrs. R. in St. Louis. I suppose that is the one you mean. It is on Nov. 5 and they wanted us for a reception committee. Is there another meeting by the Kiwanis somewhere else? I don't want to go, but if I'm in the state I'll have to. Let's let it ride and see what happens.,I was going to the War College this morning to hear a lecture on Gen. Lee by Douglas Freeman, but found I had a flat tire and it was just as well I didn't go because it turns out the Senate meets at eleven. Bill Kitchen has been here two days and has almost talked me to death. Made me miss the show at the National last night. They sent me a couple of passes at Halsey's request and I didn't get to use 'em. They say the show's good too. After Bill left last night Hatch called up and he, Minton, Tom Stewart and myself played penny anti [sic] poker in Hatch's room until midnight. I was the big winner and it was sixty cents. We had a lot of fun kidding Hatch about his bill.\nIt looks as if I'm going to get the W.P.A. Director I want. They are inclined to take Harry Easley.

We'll never let Thomason live it down. We stopped at the Arizona Ft. Huachuca and let the negro soldiers put on a review for us; and they really gave us one. Then went over to Tucson for gas and are now over the desert where we run into showers every little bit. They make us rock around quite a bit and you probably will have trouble reading this.

They were very cordial to us and the club put on a good floor show. We were back in the hotel at 12:30 this morning and up again at 6:30. Then we didn't get away until 11 AM on account of clouds.\n\nMrs. Thomason said you and she had a conversation to continue about some person you both know (she didn't tell me who it is) and that she had some new information you ought to have.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce of El Paso gave us a grand dinner where Minton made a good speech and so did Costello of Calif. We've made it a rule that only one Senator and one Congressman may talk at banquets. They gave us each a beautiful sarape [sic] which we'll have to decide how to dispose of when I get home. Maybe we can cut it in two and give each of you half.\n\nWe are now flying over the All American Canal and a lot of beautifully irrigated land.

They gave us a grand reception in San Antonio and at all the air posts around the town. Gen. Breeze met us and rode as far as Ft. Clark. That Fort is only 45 miles from old man Garner's home. He didn't come to see us and we weren't disappointed for we didn't expect him. It was reported he had gone deer hunting.\n\nFt. Clark is an old Mexican war fort. They showed us a house in which they said General Lee lived when he was a Lt. Col. of Engineers. That was after the Mex. war. Gen Breese showed us a house where Gen Hugh Johnson lived when he was a second Lt. back in 1905.,chance now. If we get into town by six o'clock we'll do well.\n\nFred Colgan lives in San Antonio but I couldn't locate him. Mrs. Conboy and her daughter came to see me. She is the mother of the boy for whom the Post in K.C. is named. He was in my battery and died in France. They are spending the winter in San Antonio. She had had a slight stroke but the daughter said she insisted on seeing me. I felt rather flattered that the old lady would want to hunt me up and in addition to that bring me a box of cigars. The occupants of the Mad House will smoke them I suppose.\n\nOur plane is marked M.A.D. on the side. It stands for Middletown Air Port and of course Mad House was the logical result. And it is one. At Mexico City we all chipped in and bought a mirimba if you know what that is and one of the pilots can play the Beer Barrell [sic] Polka on it all ready. Will write you tomorrow from El Paso. Love to you\n\nHarry.,,"

Hope you don't catch cold in the N.E. room. It is raining and cold here today. Vic was to take me out to see a gold mine west of town this afternoon but it is too bad a day. He and Jim Penman, Minton's Sec. are about to buy it. They took out $100000.00 on the adjacent property in the last 20 months. Did you know Md. had a gold mine?\nI was glad to get the clippings in your Tuesday letter, which came while I was away. I'd missed them. Sometimes the Examiner doesn't come and sometimes I get no chance to look at it. The policy came all right too.\n I was expecting to start for home today but Vic thinks I ought to see the,President and Stuart McDonald and Jesse Jones before I leave as well as the W.P.A. again. The Pres. won't be back here until Wednesday so I expect it will be Thursday afternoon before I can get away. That ought to put me home on Saturday. I am missing the greatest trip ever by the military affairs subcommittee on appropriations. They leave here on the 10th, go to Ft. Knox, Ft. Sill, San Antonio, Brownsville Tx., Vera Cruz, Guatamala [sic], Nicaraugua [sic], Panama, San Salvador, Mexico City, San Diego, Seatle [sic], Denver and back to Washington on Dec 10. Army bombers are the transports and they have one plane for baggage. Wouldn't that be a trip? I don't suppose you'd let me go and I shouldn't anyway.\n Here's an exclusive cover for Margie.

We ate ours at the American Embassy in Mexico City. Hope Uncle Jim got something done on those teeth and I hope the ham turned out all right. Vic's statement about the house,is as true as it can be. I was also glad to get the Shoop's essay on the Pres' 3rd term in Missouri. Glad you went to see Mamma. Mary said she was most pleased with the present and was glad to see you. I believe Clark will be all right.\n\nThat telegram you received from Miami was sent from the Tehautepec Isthmus at an elevation of 13700 feet with no land in sight but two very tall mountain peaks. We were delayed in Mexico City by fog. Got up at 5 A.M. after going to bed at 2:30 with the intention of leaving at 7 o'clock. We got off at 11 A.M. and came straight through without a hitch.\n\nInspected Ft. Sam Houston today and Kelly Field. Had a grand lunch at the officers club and Maury Maverick took us on a tour of the Alamo. Most interesting. Mrs. Maverick asked particularly to be remembered to you. I have been riding all day with the congressman who beat Maury. He's a dandy fellow too. We leave here tomorrow to go to El Paso.\n\nI am shipping you the souvenirs and my summer clothes. There are,three little bottles of that supposed-to-be finest French perfume, which I thought I'd give to you and Margie and Mary. There is another box with four little bottles in it I thought might do for the girls in the office and Mrs. Messall. There is a white sweater for you and a blue scarf for you and two blue sweaters for Margie. There are four little petit-point purses, one for your mother, one for mine, and one each for the Noland girls. There are two filigree silver bracelets, one for you and one for Mary and a little one,[letterhead]                                    \n[emblematic shield]\nThe St. Anthony                      \nSan Antonio     \n[/letterhead]  \n\nfor Margie. There are rings for all of you. The one with the big round set for perfume I thought maybe you'd like. There's a little bracelet for Marian and a little ring for David.\n\nThere are three Guatemala lunch cloths, which I thought maybe you'd want to give to Christie, May and Natalie, and then if you wanted to,them you could. There are three shirts for the boys at the farm and a ring for Martha Ann. The jackets were so pretty I bought four of them, and you will have to help me to decide what to do with them.\n\nThought you could give one of the little rugs or runners to J.C. and one to your mother and one to mine and one to Christine.\n\nIf you don't like this distribution and you think of a better one or there is anything you want, why just take it. The coats are the only puzzle. I thought maybe you and Margie might want one apiece, and then we could decide what to do with the other two. I hope you'll notice one of 'em is blue. This is a picture of old which I hope you'll have framed and let me claim. There's a box of Yardley soap for you, and the Chinese jewelry you can do what you please with; it was,given to me. The watch is for Margie, and the sewing bag was evidently wrapped up by mistake, for I didn't buy it. Maybe the old lady in Guatemala had a stroke of conscience for charging so much and threw it in. I think those rugs and runners are exquisite and you keep as many as you want to. I don't [underlined] want to give away [/underlined] the shoes and summer clothes. I can use 'em next year. Hope you won't think I was too extravagant. The broach is for Aunt Ella, and the extra rings are for the office force if you think it all right. Love to you.\n\nHarry,,"

I have been busy as can be trying to get my desk straightened up and trying to make up my mind on the trip. It is expected to be one of the finest ever made for military inspection. I don't know how we are ever going to have enough clean clothes. We only stop a day at each place except Panama and San Antonio where the stay is to be four days. They say we must have Tuxedo and whites for Central America and Panama and winter clothes for San Francisco and the north. But I guess we'll make out.,Mr. Charles G. Ross opened up his heart and invited me to attend the Gridiron dinner on Dec. 9 as his guest and they are only allowed one. What do you suppose caused that? Do you reckon he's having a change of heart for next year? I accepted and if the bombers don't fall I'll attend. It may do me some good.\n Les Byam just called up and told me that Long had really resigned so the rumor had some foundation. The old so and so should never have taken the job in the first place. But that's another cog in the Gov's wheel. If they get Graves and they will there'll be some difficulty in getting votes even in Jackson County. I'm going on the trip and forget about it. Hope you won't worry too much and that you won't feel I'm running out on you. I've never taken any of these trips because you couldn't go and that's all that been to me now. Will call tomorrow night.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n Love to you.

You'd better keep the cook. Hope Bruce can give Agnes Fraher a job. I'm sure he will.\n\nWell the Mexicans out did the other in their reception. We were late because we had to go to Vera Cruz and land on account of fog. We went up 13700 feet when we crossed the Isthmus of Tehauntepec and all we could see was a carpet of white clouds like snow with Orizaba and Popocatepetl sticking up through. Orizaba,is 18077 high, the second highest peake [sic] in North America, and Popo is 17700. Both are snow covered and look like picture mountains. We must have been at least 100 miles from them when we saw them first. We stayed a couple of hours at Vera Cruz and then went up to 11000 feet again over the clouds with only Orizaba visible. After flying about 30 minutes the sun cleared the fog and we had a birds eye view of Cortes route to Mexico in 1521. The city lies in the most beautiful valley and it is some town. Paris or N.Y. can't touch it. I never have been in a liver or more beautiful city. The Mex Senate and House gave us a grand lunch (3 hours late) and then Uncle Josephus [Josephus Daniels - U.S. Ambassador to Mexico] put on a state dinner for us. The embassy is finer and more spacious than the White House. We are waiting now to leave when it clears up. Hope I can mail this before we do.\n\nLove to you Harry.\n\nI am broker than ever.

Your letter from Salvador came today by a Congressman we left up there, but there are no letters here in Panama. For some reason the mail didn't come through. Of course I'm disappointed to put it mildly.\n\nWe have had two very strenuous days. Inspected three forts, a lot of artillery emplacements and had,a dinner party with the commanding general last night. It was a grand party at the \"High Hat\" Union Club in Panama City.\n\nThis morning we flew over the Canal Zone in special planes from Panama to Colon and back again. Before that we watched a ship go through a lock at the Mariflores [Miraflores] Locks.\n\nThis afternoon the American Ambassador had a reception for us and this evening Captain,Callient and his wife took me to dinner again at the Union Club.\n\nThe Capitan was a Lt and instructor for my regiment at Ft. Riley on several occasions. He was very glad to see me and treated me as if I were the President of the U.S.A.\n\nI bought a watch for Margaret today so don't buy her one. It is an American watch but sells at half price down here. I thought it would,be a good opportunity to get her one.\n\nWe must take this trip on a boat sometime. It is most enjoyable so they say.\n\nHope I get a letter tomorrow.\n\nKiss Margie. Love to you Harry.\n\nHere are some pictures taken on the way down.

One more day and we'll be in San Antonio and I'm glad. The American Minister at Guatemala gave a grand party for us but the President didn't come. He looks like Napoleon and wants to act it I guess.\n\nOne of the young Cabots from Boston is Secretary to the legation and after we got used to his Harvard accent he wasn't a bad fellow and his wife is a charming person. She was much more cordial to us than Madam la Minister. Anyway we're glad we're on our way. Nicaragua was the high spot of the trip even if it was as hot as hades.\n\nGuatemala is a beautiful place though and there are more things to see and to buy. If I'd stayed another day I'd have had to wire home for money. (We are up,9500 ft and the boat is rocking and the pen feeds to fast). I have more ink on my hands than goes on the paper.\n\nI'll say again that this is a most beautiful ride. The blue Pacific on the left, high mountains on the right with snow and then a smoking one and a perfectly lovely plain under us.\n\nI am very anxious to get to Mexico City because I'm expecting a lot of mail.

I wrote Margie on the plane today and it got so rough I could not write any more. Sent her the place card of the President of Nicaragua and a specially stamped envelope he gave me for her and when it was smooth enough to write again we were landing here. I have had no sickness of any kind and I've gained five pounds on the trip. I look like the German Ambassador. It was as rough as it ever gets this morning and I was still all right. We had to wait for the people who went to Honduras to join us at the airport at Managua and therefore didn't leave until after 10 o'clock. It was one when we landed here and we were supposed to arrive at 10:30.\n\nThe President of Nicaragua is a regular fellow. He met us when we landed, gave us a reception at his house - palace would be a better word - had an informal dinner for us at the finest club I've been to, and then saw us off this morning. When I told him that Margie went to school with his daughter he gave me his place,card, endorsed to her, and brought the stamp cancellation to the airport this morning.\n\nWe went to the races this afternoon where we met the President of Guatemala. He is said to be the best of the Central American Presidents. His name is Ubico and is given credit for eliminating graft in this country - the only one south of the Rio Grande where it has been done. Even Mr. Somoza hasn't tried to eliminate it.\n\nI went to dinner with Lt. Col. Harold Thompson in Panama the night before I left. He was stationed at Kansas City with the Cavalry Reserve for a long time. The Post Exchange Officer was there with his wife and they took me over to the exchange and I bought some very fine French perfume and they gave me some beautiful Chinese jewelry that sells for just nothing. Don't buy anyone any Christmas presents until you've seen my pack when I get home. I think I have something for every body in the family and a lot of extras you can do as you please with--I told you about a watch for Margie. Well I got a Scotch cashmere sweater for her dad. Some Guatemalan Indian woven things that are perfectly beautiful--luncheon clothes for bridge tables etc. Maybe you'll want to send them back but I hope you won't--and I still have Mexico City to shop in. We went to the fair this afternoon after the [illegible] and it was the most colorful one I've ever seen. The manager told us that there were 100000 people attended. 37000 of them rode the roller coaster. Every Indian Tribe in Central America had an exhibit. Wish you could have seen it. Hope to get tomorrow's letter off on time.\n\nKiss Margie. Love to you. Harry,,"

On top of all the neutrality foolishness Milligan and Clark have been maneuvering on some appointments in Milligan's office and trying to put me in a hole. I think they have failed. Then Canfil came in with a whole string of trouble which I got straightened out to some extent and now John Madden and R.R. Brewster are here on a parole for Pendergast. There isn't a chance for anything but a lot of ugly headlines. I think Madden realizes it but Brewster I'm sure wouldn't care if they came.,I'm glad the Senate quit until Thursday. I can fly to St. Louis this evening and catch a plane back here Thursday morning and by that time maybe they'll be gone.\nVic was taking a lot for granted on that Crown thing but there is already a profit of $25000 on it so I guess he did me a favor at that. If I'd not been so ethical in times past I maybe could have retired gracefully now. I'd rather be in my position. But it's not so good for my dependants, I'm sorry to say.\nKiss Margie. Love to you.

I have an invitation to go to Virginia Beach on Friday with legionnaire friends at Richmond but I doubt if I can go. Probably if I did, I'd get a case of sunburn that I can as well do without. I'm taking the ham to the kitchen to be baked for adjournment. So you see we are getting close.\nIt must be lonesome without the kids. You never realize how much you want 'em around until it's too late. You can sympathize with me when you and Margey ran off.\nThe K.C. Star, the Post-Dispatch , and the Star-Times in St. Louis are giving Mr.,Stark dig after dig. It looks as if their hero has feet of clay (or rotten apples). The political situation is going to be something to write history about next year, and if I do win out then watch out. I've made some good friends up here and we'll go to town in accomplishment the next six years.\n I am giving a party tonight to some of the boys working here like Harry and Joe and Fred. There'll be twenty of 'em including Bud but not Bill Dryden. I was afraid Bill might get drunk and beat up Millie. It will be at the Washington Hotel and will cost me $50.00 but it'll be a good investment. Most of 'em will contribute more than that next year, some of 'em already have. Hope to see you soon.

I'd like to see Pikes Peak and some of the other things they brag about out there up close, and I'd also like to do it the leisurely way-if that's possible. Also be glad to have your mother along. The car's plenty big enough to haul all you'll need, unless you stay a month, and four people-and do it comfortably.\nMy party for the boys was a grand success. There were twenty two of them and only two overseas and they came,that way. I'll let you guess who that two were because you know 'em as well as I do. They didn't stay very long after dinner. The rest of the outfit played penny anti, settled on a ten per cent basis. That is they bought a so called dollar's worth of chips and paid ten cents for 'em. The biggest loss was 35 cents and that was the host's.\n Have been getting bills through for various lobbyists and trying to get Jimmy Byrnes to let Schwellenbach and La Follette have money to keep on making headlines as well as fronting for Wagner to do the same thing on banking and currency. Funny they pester me-Tydings and Townsend are the other members of the committee. Maybe I've answered it.\nHope to see you soon and be on the way to Colorado.

You really must have gotten up before breakfast to make an eight o'clock appointment. Mighty glad it is raining that ought to mean a corn crop. You must have been terribly put out when Elsie couldn't stay all day. What?\nI've been spending a very pleasant hour with Jim Byrnes reporting requests for funds by various committees of the Senate for special investigations. He's a smart boy and has these birds all catalogued in the right index. Tydings and Townsend ran out on us and we had to take the buck. We gave 'em a little and none of 'em what they wanted. But they don't expect to get what they want, that's the reason they ask for too much.,But they'll raise hell I suppose. The Lending Bill is dead and so is the Housing. We ought to be done soon. Hope by Saturday anyway. My gold clock just struck twelve, the regular one says eleven and the Senate bell just rang for a session. Looks like we might get done sure enough. I've got to get that ham over and get it cooked.\nWhatever you want to do in Colo will suit me. I'd like to ride the cog road to the top of Pike's Peake [sic] and see the Royal Gorge and Estes Park and have lunch at the Broadmoor or Antlers or whatever Mellons Hotel is in Colo Springs. So you arrange your schedule accordingly. Another quorum call and I must run.

I remember once going to Washington Park with our washwoman to a Fourth of August celebration. I'll never forget it. Had chicken and catfish fried in corn meal and was it good!\nThe short but sweet note of Wednesday just now came. The girls usually bring it right in when the letter comes. They seem to think it makes things easier on them when I get my letter. Was nice to have lunch with Mrs. Moffett & Miss Carr.\nI spent all day yesterday getting bills through. Got my R.R. bridge bill passed and one special one for the R.I. R.R.,to build a bridge at Randolph. Also got one through approving a boundary settlement between Missouri & Iowa.\nI was in the chair yesterday awhile and Johnson of Colorado was making a speech on keeping beer ads off the radio. I wrapped for order and requested that the Senate be quiet so the Senator from Colorado could be heard-and the Senator from Colorado said he didn't want to be heard, he was just making a speech. I had to really call for order then.\nWe'll get done today and I should be home a week from tomorrow if everything holds together. Guess my trip to Va Beach will have to go by the board. Guffey wants me to expound the Battle of Gettysburg to him Sunday. I won't if I can dodge it.\n Kiss Margey. Love to you.      Harry.\nI am tired.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C.

You must have had my letter, by this time about my party for the boys. It was a grand success. Never expected you to put on one for 'em. It was out of the question. Thought I ought to so they could talk back home--and they will.\nMr. Maloney is off the payroll and I'm not so very sorry I missed the dinner. Was most happy to talk to you just now. Uncle Bill says \"not so very\" and \"just now\" are strickly [sic] NY-Mo colloquialisms. Well maybe they are but they express what we want to say.\nMy ham went over big. We had it today at noon. The Vice President, Barkley, Wheeler, Jim Byrnes, Guffey, Hatch of the famous bill, Minton, Lucas, Herring (without the blond), Swartz, Chavez, La Follette, Burke, Austin, Stewart, Halsey, and Biffle were,present. If you'll read the Record today, you'll wonder how that outfit could sit down together, but they did and had a grand time. Maybe Johnny Walker, Ballantine, and Mr. Gin had something to do with it, but it was a most pleasant party. And they all expressed a hope that I'd be elected in 1940, and I'm crazy enough to believe they meant it. Anyway, they meant it while the alcoholic gentlemen mentioned above had control.\nThe Arcade Sunshine Laundry just about ruined my tan suit Ted made for me. I told Reathel and Catherine if you were here, I'd get a new one-and they've gone to work on the laundry. Maybe I will anyway.\nHope to see you in at least seven days. I'm not going to drive home first and I may go to Nashville on the way home to get some Andy Jackson facts for a speech.\nKiss Margey, love to you, Harry,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 1 AUG 5 9-PM 1939\" ; 3 stamps each 1 cent United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

Hope you enjoyed your luncheon with Mrs. Moffett and Miss Carr and that you found the skirt you want for Skinny. Hope she hasn't got a cold. Maybe she is making sure of the Colorado trip. I'm glad you let the Andrews woman work on you again. The report sounds very encouraging. Your blood pressure is ten higher than mine. As long as it stays in that neighborhood there is no danger from that quarter.\nI'm cleaning house this morning, washed three handkerchiefs and six socks, threw away a couple of bushels of papers, and can see a couple of,square feet of the mahogany on the desk. Hope to be able to pull out of here by Wednesday or Thursday. Mr. Stark is supposed to be here today, but I don't suppose I'll see him. Had a letter from J. John Gillis this morning in which he said the Dems in Mo couldn't win unless Stark was nominated for V.P. He's a crazy Republican lawyer in K.C.\nMy ham party was a success as I told you yesterday. Everyone there wished me success in the next election and some of 'em are going to actively help. This Congress, though has been a pain in the neck and will help to beat a lot of Democrats and I may be one of them. Kiss Margie, Love you. \nHope to see you soon.

I told you last night I wouldn't write you anymore but two nice letters came this morning in the first mail and thought I'd better write at least one more. It was nice to talk to you last night and it'll be nicer to talk to you Friday or Saturday in person.\n You keep right on taking those treatments. I don't care what they cost if they cure you. The checking up is a good thing too. I'm sure the house arrangement in Colo will be fine. Maybe they won't have any twin beds!\nHad a letter from Myra this morning. Said she is feeling fine and wanted to be remembered to all of us. She is going to the Fair on a boat.,Yesterday was some day. Went to see the President about a bill and he insisted on talking Mo. politics and telling me what a funny Governor we have. He didn't say phony but that's what he meant. Actual quotation \"I do not think your Governor is a real liberal-He has no sense of humor\" \"He has a large ego.\" These statements in a lot of other conversation I can't repeat now. Invited me to ride on his train across Missouri. Said \"Be sure and get on that train for you can rest assured your Gov will without any invitation.\" Then I saw Tommy Corcoran in Guffey's office and he quoted Charlie Hay in almost the very words of the President.\nSaw Mr. Clark immediately afterwards. He was cockeyed but very affectionate. Said he was going to announce for me as soon as he got to Missouri and made a survey. It's all too much for one day. Kiss Margey.

I unloaded my baggage and got the policeman on the door to help me carry it up. Cochran had left word for me to come to a party for Dickmann, but I was too tired to make it.\nWent to bed at ten o'clock after reading the Star and the News. Bill Helm just called me and told me I'd been selected as the principal speaker at the truckmen's meeting in Chicago and that they'd pay me for coming. If aviation and truck and rails all are of the same mind, Wheeler's and my bill must be pretty good. Anyway I'll go talk with,them. Propaganda is the thing these days. There are at least five thousand cards and letters on the table that came before I did, and this morning's mail is so big it will take all day and maybe tomorrow to distribute it. We got nearly a thousand on the first mail. Father Coughlin and the pacifists are organized. It will have no effect on me.\nI heard Hitler's speech over the radio as I came along yesterday and he did himself no good in this country. Dorothy Thompson peels the hide off Mr. Lindbergh in her column this morning and I agree with her. We'll have a historic session. Wish you were here. I'm going to have a lonesome time.

Bundschu and Ellen came in at ten and some dozen other Missourians and Gen Danford also came. They all wanted into the opening session. I had one ticket and that was all I could get. I took 'em all to the Senate opening and they had to stay out of the House for the joint session. I sent the Bundschus to the Bureau of Engraving and the F.B.I. and they were just as happy as if they'd got into the joint session. Took 'em to dinner at Hogarth's tonight and Danford is having us all to,lunch at the Army and Navy Club tomorrow. I'll take 'em to Mt. Vernon in the morning and I guess they'll be happy. Will see 'em again in a few minutes. They're stopping at the Carroll Arms. Couldn't get in anywhere else. C.C. happened to tell 'em he knew me and that's how he got a room. The special session was a grand affair and the Pres. made his best speech. Burke, Austin and John Miller all walked across the street with me and they expressed the opinion that he had rung the bell. Clark, Nye and old Walsh sat and looked down their noses all the time he was speaking and never applauded once.

Harry Salisbury and Fred Whitaker have been helping to open the mail. It's getting bigger & bigger. We had 1500 letters on the first mail. Most happy to get the clippings. Hadn't seen any of them. Andrew has been one of the Administrations best men. Southern hates labor so much he can't see any good in a person who is fair to them. Got room 416 at the Carroll Arms. It is a very nice room. They gave C. Bundschu #407. I think it's the same one that you, Margie & I stayed in.\nTook 'em to Mt. Vernon & Arlington this morning and had a grand lunch with Gen. & Mrs. Danford. I took the Gen. back,to work and Mrs. Danford took the B's for further sight seeing. I came back to the office to help with the mail.\nHope Bill & Marg had a nice time with mamma, and I expect they did. I'd have had a nice time with her. Danford & I talked the war over. We're both right blue over it. Neither of us think that England & France can lick the Germans and Russians. They were beaten in the last war when we got in. If Germany can organize Russia and they make England give up her fleet look out--we'll have a Nazi or nasty world. The President seems to have had a good reaction. Minton says it'll take a month. Every body else says Jan 1. I don't know.\nMr. Shoop just can't see how Clark can support anyone but Stark. Well he may do it. Send the clippings.\nKiss Margie, love to you, Harry\nSend the clippings,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 1 SEP 22 8-PM 1939\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

Joe, Harry, Fred, the two girls and the Senator and then we don't get 'em all opened. We have to open them because the regular mail is mixed with 'em. The day will be right now that yours was in the first thousand. Sorry about Frank. He needs rest worse than any of us. But he's as hard headed as his niece. Maybe that's where she got it. Go ahead and look at the Packard and the Buick and let me know what they say. Hope you didn't hit any bumps when you had May aboard. I can still remember.\n I am sure the underwear will be,all right and when the snaps come off you can still have the privilege of sewing on buttons.\n C.C. and Ellen left just now. They said they had a good time. I did my best but I'm no sightseeing guide. You should have been here. Mrs. Danford took them to Annapolis yesterday afternoon.\n I am somewhat depressed by the world situation. It's terrible. The radio says Holland has flooded its lands and that Russia and Germany will go into Rumania. Then these nutty letters-they'd drive a sane man to drink. Two came to me addressed Cenator and one spelled war with two r's. They are nearly all from St. Louis and nearly all have German names. The Bund is working.\nKiss Margie.

Mr. Southern evidently has forgotten his statement that no governor should run for another office while he's in power. I suppose he could never bring himself to ask the governor to resign while he's running. That of course would be the ethical thing for him to do.\nI am most happy you are again back in line. You should not have gotten out seriously. My patronage troubles were the result of the rotten situation in Kansas City and also the jealous disposition of my colleague. While the President is unreliable, the things he's stood for are in my opinion,best for the country, and jobs should not interfere with general principles. With most people they do. I can't say that they have in the case of Minton and Schwellenbach. We are all in the same boat.\nDon't count on an early adjournment. There won't be any such thing. It will take five weeks at least. I may be clear off but we'll have to wait & see. I may go to St. Louis by plane tomorrow. They all say I should be there. Glad you got the kitchen furniture fixed up. I forgot to put a special on the Friday letter so you won't get it today. Harry & I just opened and piled up another 1000 letters--just another 1000. The girls will be that much ahead. They come mostly from St. Louis Germans.\n Wonder if Margie has a sore finger or something? I've looked in vain for a letter from her. Kiss her anyway.

They fired one when we stepped off the planes, fired one when we called on the general in the afternoon, and fired one this morning when we inspected the Coast Artillery Post. They've shown us the bug guns, 16 in., the little guns, the machine guns, the new lock sites and have told why we should buy the Gallapigos [Galapagos] Islands from Peru or Ecuador and Cocos Island from Costa Rica.\n\nTonight we have a formal dinner with the Governor of the Zone and tomorrow go to a reception by the American,Ambassador to Panama. Monday we go to Colon and Tuesday at 7 A.M. take off for Guatemala and Honduras. I'll bet Skinny can't tell me what the capital of Honduras is.\n\nYesterday afternoon I went out riding with four Congressmen and saw Old Panama. They are just now digging it out of the jungle after about 250 years. Morgan the Buccaneer destroyed it in 1671.\n\nI was surprised at the immensity of the cathedral and the other ruins. I sent Margaret a card with a picture of the Tower on it and it was a tower not a spiral. Trees 3 ft in diameter had grown right up through the walls.\n\nI am hoping for an air mail letter this afternoon when the Pan American comes in. We are sumptuously fixed up here and are royally entertained. Will tell you more tomorrow. Hope you got the $300 cable I sent.\n\nKiss Margie. Love to you Harry."

You should have had a special Sunday because I didn't forget to put the stamps on it last Friday. You asked about Elsie and Oscar. You should have had my story about them by this time. Oscar called me this morning and I told him I hadn't been able to re-instate him. They are going to Missouri tomorrow. I am sorry about it but what can I do? He was warned time and again and I had them to keep him twice. Maybe it'll do him good and he'll awake to the facts.\nOld man Logan's heart quit on him last night and Barkley asked me to go with him to the funeral. I guess I'll have to go. Seems as if I'm the regular funeral escort - but it's,hard to say no in a case that is so close to Barkley.\nWe are still having cold mean rains but it is lighter than it was yesterday, so maybe we'll get your nice weather eventually.\nThe Hon. Roy McKitterick was in to see me this morning and I had a lot of political gossip from him. He's a candidate for governor and I suppose he thought it might be well to see me since I had so much to do with making the last one! Mr. Clark became exceedingly friendly today, for some reason too - and to top it off the Hon. Kimbrough Stone came in and spent a most engaging fifteen minutes. I don't exactly know what he wanted but it must have been something. He asked for copies of 1869 & 2009 - the Wheeler-Truman R.R. bills. Hope Margaret finally arose and that the hay ride wasn't entirely too much for her.\nGive her a kiss and love to you. \nHarry.,[circular postmark, stamp: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 6 OCT 3 330PM 1939\" ; 3 cents United States Postage]\n\nMrs. Harry S.

I have certainly been lonesome without any letters. I suppose they went to March Field and they'll send them to Hamilton so I'll get 'em tomorrow. I called Miss Jessie and also called Polly. They both seemed very glad to hear from you. Miss Jessie said she was very lonesome for some of her Missouri friends, said she owed letters to all of them and that she thought she'd try,[letterhead]         \n [scenic background; large complex of buildings]\nThe Los Angeles\nAmbassador\n California    [/letterhead] \n\nwrite you right away. Polly said Ben is in the S.P. Hospital in San Francisco and I told her I'd try to call him up and if I had a minute off I'd go and see him. She also said she owed you a letter.\n\nWe had quite a day today. They took us through the Douglas Plant, Lockheed and Vultee Plants and then we inspected some flying cadets at Burbank. There were four boys from Missouri. One from Fulton, one from Bowling,[letterhead]         \n [scenic background; large complex of buildings]\nThe Los Angeles\nAmbassador\n California    [/letterhead] \n\nGreen and two from Kansas City. They seemed very glad to see me. Then we went to lunch at M.G.M. where Mr. Mayer himself presided. Will Hays was there and the Mayor of Los Angeles and William Powell, Mickey Rooney, Mary Howard, Lana Turner, the O'Sullivan lady, Helen Gilbert and Janet McDonald. Miss McDonald had to run for a set so I didn't get her name on the card for Margaret and I didn't see Mr. Powell until he was introduced,,[letterhead]         \n [scenic background; large complex of buildings]\nThe Los Angeles\nAmbassador\n California    [/letterhead] \n\nso I missed him too. Leni Lynn and Kathryn Grayson sang for us. They have beautiful voices and are lovely children - one 14 and the other seventeen. Mr. Mayer said that the Lynn child had a better voice than Deana Durban. She sang two beautiful songs and the Last Rose of Summer for an encore.\n\nI went to dinner tonight with Mr. Eastman, the head of the Moral Rearmament movement here. He has a charming wife and a grown son and daughter.,[letterhead]         \n [scenic background; large complex of buildings]\nThe Los Angeles\nAmbassador\n California    [/letterhead] \n\nHe also had in a couple of his neighbors and two of the assistants to Dr. Buchman. Then they took me to the broadcasting station and the Mayor gave me his time on the radio to speak on M.R.A. They had several calls after I'd finished and one was from one of the boys in my battery.\n\nWe go to San Francisco tomorrow. Will be at the Fairmount Hotel. Here's Margie's card.

We came up here from New York on the Boston and Maine Railroad by way of the crookedest and roughest track I've ridden over since the Leaky Roof quit running from Kansas City to Springfield.  Senator Brewster met us here and we had breakfast over at another hotel where we saw Claude Pepper.  He's up here for a Democratic rally tonight for the man opposing Wallace White.\n\nWe went to the launching at eleven o'clock and Mr. Pepper came too--unin-,-vited--getting into the front row for pictures, etc.  Then they balled up the program and left Kilgore out but Mrs. Kilgore christened one of the ships, so he didn't care.  He's one of the nicest men I know anyway.  They short-waved us to England.  Then we had lunch and launched some more and then put a couple of destroyers into the bay--went to a clambake and just now got in at 9:10 P.M.  \n\nThey gave me a whole lobster, half a chicken, a dozen clams, two ears of corn, a hard-boiled egg, a sweet potato half as big as my head, a cup of coffee, and two doughnuts.  All, down to the potato, was cooked on hot stones covered with seaweed and covered with canvas, piled up in a big pile.  I ate a little of everything to show my hosts I appreciated the hospitality--but it was a mess.\n\nI'd hoped for a letter here.  Will write you from Dexter tomorrow.\n\nKiss Margie, love to you,\nHarry,,"

No your taste\nin hats is not skrewey. If you\never cultivate the same sort of \nyen for crazy hats that the two you \ngave those Paris ones to, have I'll\nrefuse to go to church with you.  I'd\nsay that is a dire threat. Your hats \nsuit me and theirs do not.\n  I can't get  Chanel #5.  Padre says there\nIs none to be had--not even on the \nblack market. His home station is in\nParis.  But I managed to get some other\nkind for $6.00 an ounce at the American\nP.X.  They said it is equal to #5 and,2\nsells for $35.00 an ounce at home. So\nif you don't like it a profit can be\nmade on it.  I bought you a Belgian \nlace luncheon set- the prettiest thing\nyou ever saw.  I'm not going to tell \nyou what it cost--you'd probably have\na receiver appointed for me and if-\nfinally take over the strong fox.  But\nI came out a few dollars to the good\nin the game of chance on the boat--so\nit's invested in a luxury for you.\nThe Padre has had a good time.  He\nand Charlie Ross hit it off perfectly,\nand of course Vaughan, Vardaman and\nCanfil were his old buddies of Ft. Riley\nand Leavenworth.  I'm going to mass\nat 1130, presided over by him.  I've,already been to a Protestant service \nso I guess I should stand in good \nwith the Almighty for the coming\nweek--and my how I'll need it.\nBut I seem to have Joe + Winnie\ntalking to themselves and both are be-\ning exceedingly careful with me.\nUncle Joe gave his dinner last night.\nThere were at least 25 toasts--so\nmuch getting up and down that there\nwas practically no time to eat or \ndrink either--a very good thing.  Being\nthe super-duper guest I pulled out at\n11 o'clock after a lovely piano and violin \nconcert by a dirty faced quartet.  The \ntwo men play the piano. The two women \nthe violin.  I never heard any better\nones.  Chopin, Tochiakowsky, Listz, Hungarian,postmark date 7-24-45\nRhapsody, Russian, Ukrainian and Polish\nfolk dances--it was real music.\nSince I'd had America's No. 1 pianist to\nplay for Uncle Joe at my dinner he\nhad to go me one better.  I had one and\none violinist--and he had two of each.\nHe talked to me confidentially at the \ndinner and I believe things will be\nall right in most instances.  Some\nthings we won't and can't agree on--but\nI have already what I came for.  Hope\nI can break it off in a few days\nThe weather is perfect and I feel\nfine.  The boys say there's never been\na conference as well presided over.\nThe Senate gave me some good experience\nLots & lots of love, kiss the family,\nHarry"

Mr. Byrner and I walked from the Berlin White House (it's still yellow trimmed in dirty red-dirty yellow too) to Mr. Churchill's place about three blocks, down the street on up (it's level so either one is all right.) Churchill had phoned Gen. Vaughan, my chief of protocol, that he would greatly, very greatly appreciate it if I would arrive a few minutes late as I happened to be the senior guest and Uncle Joe should realize it. Well we arrived as diected and were recieved by the P.M. and his nine daughter. Mary. I had to shake hands with Marshall, now Generallisimo Stalin, General,,of the Army Antonov, Marshall Zhukov, Field Marshall Montgomery, Lord this + that and a lot more Ruskies and Limies, we went out to dinner. It was a very colorful affair, as you can see. I am enclosing you the menu and the list of guests. The menu is signed to you by J. Stalin + Winston Churchill and the guest list is signed by all the guests. Stalin and Churchill paid your pop a most high compliment by saying that my presiding had been the ablest they'd ever seen. That;s what Adm. Reahy and all the rest say but it is hard to believe because I've had plenty of trouble.\nChurchill and his crowd went home today to see how the vote in England came out. I am going to Frankfurt tomorrow,and inspect some American divisions.\nFriday we resume sessions and I believe we shall wind up Sunday so I should be out to sea on Tuesday and home by Sunday August 4th.\nHad a telegram today saying Harry had safely landed at Washington Air Port. He should be home by the time this letter gets to you. I hope you and your momma will be at the White House when I get back to Washington.

It made me very, very homesick. While I am nicely situated here and am waited upon by everybody, that doesn't fill the gap.\n\nIt was a nice letter. I know you must have enjoyed Janie's visit very much and I'm sure she did. You keep in touch with your old country grandma as much as you can and pet Aunt Mary a little because she's worth all we can do for her - she's been so good to her mother. You should have seen,,your cousin Harry when he came here. He was on the Queen Elizabeth at Glasco [sic] and they took him off and flew him here. His first plane ride. Fred Canfil and Gen. Vaughan showed him everything there was to see and I sent him to N.Y. by plane. Should hear from him today if he lands safely.\n\nFather Tiernan is here and he looks fine. I am going to church twice this morning. At 10 o'clock to a Protestant service and at 11:30 the Padre will put on a special mass for me. Then Winnie is comming [sic] to see me, maybe to stay for lunch after which I'll have to work the rest of the day on the conference.,3\n\nMr. Stalin held his dinner last evening and was it a dandy. Started with cavier [sic] and vodka and mare's milk butter, then smoked herring, then white fish and vegetables, then venison and vegetables then duck and chicken and finally two deserts [sic] ice cream and strawberries and a wind up of sliced watermelon. White wine, red wine, champaign [sic] and cognac in liberal quantities and a toast every five minutes to somebody or something - to the United States and its great, magnifique Presidente, to me individually, to the US Army, the US Navy, the US working people and the same procedure [sic] to the British & the Russians; to Molotov, Byrnes, Eden the American Ambassador to Russia,,The Russian Ambassador to U.S.A., ditto for the British, to the interpreters and finally Joe and I had to go shake hands with and toast the musicians. Two excellent pianists and two women violinists. They were as good as you've ever listened to (but they had dirty faces). But it was one grand and glorious evening. I fooled 'em on the drinks and there was so much getting up and down that I didn't have to eat much either. Got back to my boarding house (Berlin White House - it's yellow & red) at 11:30 and was in bed asleep at 12:30. \n\nKiss mama for me and take a dozen for yourself.\n\n                                                                                    Load of love\n                                                                                                  Dad.\n                                                                                x x x x,[printed] THE WHITE HOUSE                         [circular post mark on rim: \"WASHINGTON, D.C. 23 1945\"; center: \"JUL 24 12-M\"\n                                                                                   [stamp: \"AIR 8 CENTS MAIL; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\"\n\n\n                                                      Miss Margaret Truman\n                                                      219 North Delaware St.\n                                                      Independence, Mo"

I'm not sure what has been my worst day.  But here is a situation [fraut?] with terrible consequences.  Suppose, for instance that Italy should fold up and that Tito then would march into the Po Valley.  All the Mediter[scratched out]e[end scratched out]anean Coast of France then is open to Russian occupation and the iron curtain comes to Bordeaux, Callais, Antwerp and the Hague.  We withdraw from Greece and Turkey and [underlined]prepare[end underlined] [underlined]for[end underlined] [underlined]war[end underlined]. It just must not happen.  But here I am confronted with a violently opposition Congress whose committees,would cost us 400 billions and untold lives, mostly civilian.  So I must do what I can.  I shouldn't write you this stuff but you should know what I've been facing since Potsdam.\n\n      Bill Helm's book is a great disappointment.  It is a build up of Bill and not a biography of me.  Too bad.  The Potomac has a bad effect on all of 'em.\n\n      Hope you have a nice time a good party at the Menhbach.  I'm sure you will.  I haven't resumed my walks yet but will in a day or two.  Too much to read.  Gen. Bradley made a report to me today on his European trip and he remarked on m y having had to make more momentous decisions than nearly any other president.  He's right, and I hope,2\n\nwith few exceptions are living in 1890: is not representative of the country's thinking at all.  But I've a job and it must be done - win lose or draw.\n\n     Sent letter to Taber, Bridges, Vandenburg and Eaton requesting them to call their committees together as soon as possible.  Had my food committee together and will make a radio speech Sunday.  To feed France and Italy this winter will cost 580 million, the Marshall Plan 16 1/2 billions.  But you know in October & November 1945 I canceled 63 billions in appropriations 55 billions at one crack.  Our war cost that year wast set at 105 billions. The 16 1/2 is for a four year period and is for [underlined]peace[end underlined]. A Russian war,most of 'em have been right.\n\n     Edward Arnold came in to see me this afternoon and brought me wonderful pictures of all the Presidents.  He told me and the office force some good stories about Sam Goldwyn, Harry Warner & Syros Skourus, imitating them in their manners and voice.  It gave me sore sides from laughing.\n\n     Tell the baby I'll write her soon. Hope Frank doesn't get another boil.\n\n                              Lots of love\n                                    Harry"

Orizaba is just west of Vera Cruz and rises right out of the sea level plane to 18 700 feet.  Popo is a thousand feet lower.\n\nThe airport was lined with people and the Mexicans put on a real show for me.  The Mayor of the City and Gov. of the Federal District (the same man) made me guest of honor and presented me with a solid gold medal weighing a half,pound with the areas of the city on one side and a replica of the Aztec calender stone on the other. I wore it all day to the delight of the Mexican President.  He has a beautiful home where I called on him, and three lovely children, two boys and a girl.  I met the First Lady of Mexico and she is a charming person.\n\nThe President told me at the,banquet that she was highly pleased with the presents you sent.  They are sending you a silver tea service.\n\nLast night's affair was a colorful one. The streets were packed from the Embassy to the Palace and at least 10000 were in the square in front of it.  The President & I had to greet them from the balcony in Fraz Joseph style.  [Illegible] had such a welcome.  Hope everything is going well.  Tell Margie to  behave.  Lots of love  Harry"

I'm always uneasy when you, Margaret or any of the other members of the family are on the way to somewhere. And I always heave a sigh of relief when safe arrival is reported.\n\nThat not only applies to the family but to my official family too. Bob Landry went to Korea with Gen. Twinning [sic][Twining] and the Asst. Secretary of the Navy. I was on needles and pins until they safely returned and reported to me yesterday. Dean Acheson will arrive tomorrow and then everybody will be accounted for but Margie - one of the two most important of all. But I couldn't say no when she,,was so anxious to go. What a relief it will be when she is back in the U.S.A. again.\n\nI listened to the \"great\" five star General last night. He was a complete flop as a keynoter. He and Ike will find out something about the American Government that they did not learn at West Point, Europe or the South Pacific.\n\nMr. Bruce fixed Blevins up. I talked to Bruce myself and he is 100% for what Blevins wants to do. So I suppose all is well in that quarter.

Yesterday evening I went out to the Acheson's for dinner. The Woodwards and Florence Mahoney were there. I had a chance to talk to Dean before the others came, and Dean, Stanley, and I had a session after dinner.\n\nAs you know, we are up against it for a winning candidate in 1960. After much discussion we came to the conclusion that, at the present time, Stuart Symington is the best bet.\n\nDean said, and it's true, that we have a dozen good second-place men but no real honest to goodness first-place man. I've had a session with some of the new senators and expect, today, to have lunch,<letterhead>                                                                             The Mayflower\n                                                                                                                                                                          Washington, D.C.<letterhead>   \n\nwith Hart of Michigan, Harke of Indiana, Jennings Randolph, and Alaska's two.\n\nSam Rayburn says he's anxious to see me. I've talked to Lyndon Johnson but things are nowhere near settlement for a proper course. Maybe they never will be and then God help the country.\n\nI've almost become a pessimist! Again I wish, with everything I've got, that you were here.\n\nWe are facing the most serious situation since 1859.\n\nHope all's well with you. I've had two walks yesterday and this morning all by myself.
